officers:- 
GUIDE LINES 
 
Norms for filing and processing of representations of Judicial Officers for 
retention of official residence after transfer/retirement/death 
 
1) 
The District Judges must ensure strict compliance of these Guidelines and 
any default must be immediately brought to the notice of the Court by 
Fax/Speed Post. 
2) 
In supersession of all Court‟s Circulars on the subject, a Judicial Officer or 
his family member(s) on transfer/retirement/death, as the case may be, shall 
not retain official residence (houses belonging to Judicial Department, 
houses in the pooled housing scheme and allotted houses), beyond 30 days 
from the date of transfer/retirement/death and any default in this behalf shall 
constitute misconduct. 
Provided that Hon‟ble the Chief Justice or Judge nominated by Hon‟ble the 
Chief Justice may after recording sufficient reasons permit retention of the 
official residence on the same terms and conditions for a period of one more 
month on payment of rent as provided  in the G.O. No. R-2/32-2-9R4/69/85, 
dated 2nd January, 1992 but in no case the retention shall be allowed beyond 
two months.  
3) 
A Judicial Officer who desires to retain the official residence beyond 30 days 
must submit his representation to the High Court through the District Judge 
of the Judgeship where he is posted well in advance so as to give sufficient 
time for processing of the representation.  
4) 
In case of transfer, a copy of the representation must also be sent to the 
District Judge of the Judgeship from where the Judicial Officer has been 
transferred.  
5) 
Amongst others, the following information must be included in the 
representation:-  
 
(a) In the case of transfer, the date of notification by which the Judicial Officer 
was transferred, the date he handed over charge and the date when he took 
charge at the transferred place. 
13 
 
(b) In the case of transfer, the Judicial Officer must also mention whether he has 
been allotted any official accommodation at the transferred place and 
whether its possession has been given to him.  
(c)  In the case of retirement/death, the date of retirement/death must be 
mentioned. 
(d) The reason and the period for which the Judicial Officer desires to retain the 
official accommodation.  
6) 
Upon receipt of the representation the concerned District Judge(s) should 
forward it to the High Court within three days by Fax/Speed Post with their 
comments. The comments must mention whether the concerned Judicial 
Officer has been allotted an official accommodation at the transferred place 
and whether any other Judicial Officer of the Judgeship from where the said 
officer has been transferred requires the accommodation in his possession. 
7) 
In case of retirement/death, the representation must also be forwarded by the 
District Judge to the High Court by Fax/Speed Post within three days with 
comments which should mention whether any Judicial Officer in the 
Judgeship requires the said accommodation. 
8) 
On receipt of the aforesaid representation and comments from the District 
Judge(s), the High Court Officer must process the representation with 
expedition so that it is placed before the Nominated Judge/Hon‟ble the Chief 
Justice with the comments within three days.  
9) 
Upon receipt of the orders from Hon„ble the Chief Justice, the office must 
promptly send the communication by fax/speed post to the concerned 
District Judge for information and compliance of the order.  
10) 
The District Judge, upon receipt of the order from the High Court, must 
ensure that service of the order is made upon the Judicial Officer at once and 
information about compliance/non-compliance of the order should be sent to 
the High Court by Fax/speed Post.  
11) 
Mere pendency of the representation will not be made a ground to retain the 
official accommodation beyond the prescribed period of 30 days and the 
consequences enumerated in Clause 2 will follow if the Judicial Officer 
retains the official accommodation without any order of Hon‟ble the Chief 
Justice or the Judge nominated by Hon‟ble the Chief Justice.  
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid Court‟s 
guidelines amongst the Judicial Officers posted in your Judgeship for their 
information and strict compliance.

I am directed to say that Hon'ble Court has been pleased to pass the 
following orders: 
 
1. “All the Judicial Officers who are nominated by the Hon'ble Court for 
different training programmes are ordinarily required to undergo training as 
ordered by the Hon'ble Court.

posted on deputation subordinate to the High Court of Judicature at 
Allahabad are informed that if any nominated officer seeks exemption he is

will first satisfy himself about genuineness or otherwise of the reason shown 
by the officer in his exemption application and he will endorse his 
satisfaction on the application while recommending.

support the grounds (medical, marriage etc.) duly issued by competent

I am therefore to request you kindly to ensure the compliance of the 
aforesaid orders of the Hon'ble Court.

8. 
Issuance of health card/authority letter/identification letter   
  
C.L. No. 19/IV-f-116/2014 dated: Allahabad 22.7.2014 
 
While enclosing a copy of Judicial Officers Revolving Fund Niyamavali-

9. 
Directions for keeping the closed files regarding a complaint against 
Judicial Officer on his/her personal file maintained under Rule-429 (1) of G.R. 
(Civil), Vol-I. 
 
C.L. No. 08/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 10.02.2015 
 
 
It has been reported in several Vigilance Bureau enquiries that the provisions 
contained in Chapter XVI of G.R. (Cril) Vol. 1 are not properly complied with. It 
16 
 
has also been found that directions of the Hon‟ble Court regarding processing of 
complaints are not being observed properly. Administrative correspondence 
regarding a complaint against particular officer of the district is not kept in the file 
of that particular officer, maintained in the administrative office of that judgeship.  
 
Even after sufficient directions issued in this regard vide C.L. No. 83/Xf-21 
dated 31st May, 1971 and C.L. NO. 5/Admn. (B) Vig. Dated 23rd March, 1971, no 
uniform practice has been found for keeping the files of administrative 
correspondence regarding complaint. This result into great difficulty in locating all 
the complaints made against the particular officer in a particular district and leads 
to corrupt practice.  
 
Reiterating the above-mentioned C.L. No. 83/XF-21 dated 31st May, 1971 
and C.L. NO. 5/Admn.  (B) Vig. Dated 23rd March, 1971, I am directed to request 
you that directions contained therein shall strictly be adhered to and you are to 
ensure that all closed files regarding a complaint against judicial officer be kept on 
his/her personal file, maintained under Rule 429 (a) of G.R. (Civil), Vol. I. 
 
I am, therefore, to request you to personally ensure compliance of above 
mentioned G.L. and C.Ls. and of the directions contained in the instant circular 
letter.   
Annexure 
 
 [19] COMPLAINTS AGAINT OFFICERS 
C.L. NO. 4/Xf-21 dated 4th March, 1952 
 
All complaints against Judicial Offices should be referred to the Court for 
directions. 
C.L. NO. 83/Xf-21 dated 31st May, 1971. 
 
While forwarding complaints against Judicial Officers to the Court, District 
Judges should give their comments also and enquire into the complaints and take 
suitable action in the matter.  
C.L. No. 5/Admn. (B) Vig. Dated 23rd March, 1971. 
 
On all complaints against an officers or a member of the staff sent for 
enquiry and report, the District Judges should send complete report. It should 
invariably be to the point, thorough and objective. Whenever necessary the record 
should also be perused while sending the report and corrupt and inefficient 
officers/ officials should not be shielded. A clear opinion should always be 
expressed on the allegations made. If the allegations made are in respect of a 
pending or it decided case the opinion should be expressed in clear words but 
without being too critical of judicial independence of an officer has not to be 
curbed in any way. What has to be seen is whether the order passed is or is not 
reasonable and also whether it was passed after taking into consideration all the 
facts and circumstances of the case. 
17 
 
  
10. 
Modal code of conduct in connection with the visits of Hon‘ble Judges. 
C.L. No. 25/ Admin. G-II Dated 28-9-2016 
 
Reiterating the marginally quoted Circular Letters I am directed to communicate 
that no Judicial Officer will attend Hon‟ble Judges on the 
road side on any day. However, if some Hon‟ble Judge 
visits the district on any holyday or beyond the court hours, 
the Judicial Officer may welcome the Hon‟ble Judge at the 
Guest House. 
You are, therefore, requested to circulate a copy of the instant circular letter 
amongst all the Judicial Officers working under your supervision and control and 
to ensure strict compliance of the same in letter and spirit.

In calculating working days the following will be excluded: 
(a) Days on which courts are closed for the whole day or half day due to 
holidays or other causes.  
[Vide Court‟s CL. No. 26/1994, dated 15.3.1994 it has been directed that 
officers should be asked to claim only for half day instead of the whole 
day on which the courts are closed for half day due to sad demise of

(Now renumbered as Schedule „D‟) in calculating their working days in 
their out turn of quarterly statements]

the quarterly statement of out-turn duly verified by the District Judge.  
 
Note:- As presently the Secretaries, District Legal Services Authorities are not 
assigned judicial work and they are not required to give any quota, therefore, there 
is no necessity of granting any additional quota to them. However, in case the 
Secretaries, District Legal Services Authorities are made to discharge judicial 
27 
 
functions they will be entitled to 25% of the actual work done as additional quota 
for the work of District Legal Services Authority.  
(5) 
The standard prescribed herein is intended to represent the minimum amount 
of work expected from the officers and in most cases the Court expects that it, in 
fact, exceeded.  
(6) 
The merit of an officer will be judged by the quality of his work. The 
offices, therefore, in no circumstances will escape from quality for the sake of 
quantity.  
(7) 
If the work of any officer falls short of the prescribed standard, the 
circumstances will be clearly stated in the remarks column of the statement of out-
turn of work. A statement giving the number of cases under each head pending on 
1st of each month during the financial year will be attached. Another statement 
giving details of cases heard but not concluded will be given in accordance with

(11)  The Statement of out-turn of work will bear the name and designation of the 
official who prepares the same and also the official who checks the same. 
(12) It will be the personal responsibility of the Presiding Officer concerned to 
see that the statement, so submitted is absolutely correct.

(18) District Judges will check up the statements submitted in compliance of 
Administrative Judges‟ Circular Letter No. 8 of 1976 to ensure that Presiding 
Offices are disposing of a fair number of old cases and are not giving preference to 
new cases A specific mention should be made in the Confidential Remarks 
regarding this presiding Officers found habitually not paying due attention to 
display of old cases may not be considered fit for promotion or confirmation.  
(19) The District Judge should ensure that judgements are delivered expeditiously 
and in case of delay the Presiding officer should be asked to expedite.

Hon‟ble Court has taken a serious not over large pendency caused by non-
availability of status reports of the case, in which proceedings have been stayed by 
the Hon‟be Court. Moreover the information received in enquiries of such cases, 
serves no useful purpose because it only provides status of the cases whether they 
are pending or decided.  
 
In this regard, instead of old practice of inquiry, Hon‟ble Court has directed 
that to acquire the current status of the case, wherein proceedings have been 
terminated by Hon‟ble Court, the officers of the District Court may download the 
copy of the final order from the official website of the High Court and after getting 
it verified by the System Officer, place it on record and proceed with the case

C.L. No. 25 /Admin. ―G-II‖ Dated: Allahabad 03.8.2012 
There is a growing concern about the problems faced by HIV positive 
people while approaching courts for justice. The long-drawn legal process coupled 
with the fear of public identification, discourages them from filing cases. There is 
then a need to reform the existing procedures in order to make it more conductive 
for people living with HIV to opt for legal redress. As time is of great essence for 
people living with HIV court should treat the cases involving them on a priority 
basis in order that justice does not elude them.   
Upon consideration of the D.O. No. 1511/42/2012- Jus(M) dated 21 May, 
2012 of Minister of Law and Justice, Govt. of India, Hon‟ble court has resolved 
that priority be given for  disposal of cases of HIV positive litigants. 
Therefore, I am directed to request you to give priority in disposing of the 
cases of HIV positive litigants while keeping the identity of HIV positive person(s) 
confidential so as to make it conductive for HIV positive people to opt for legal 
redress.  
I am to request you to kindly ensure that the above directions are complied 
with by all the concerned under your administrative control, in letter and spirit.

The Hon‟ble Court (Hon‟ble Mr. Justice S.U. Khan) while hearing writ-C 
No. 8481 of 2013, Anil Kumar Jain Vs. Smt. Kamla Devi and another, noticed that 
the record of the lower court was summoned by the appellate court for disposing of 
Misc. Civil Appeal due to which no proceedings could take place in the original 
suit for 12 long years. The court has deprecated this practice and has been pleased 
to direct that in no Misc. Civil Appeal or Civil Revision under Section 115 CPC, 
the file of the trial court shall be summoned. The party filing the Misc. Appeal or 
Revision shall file such documents which are available on the file of the trial court 
and on which he wants to place reliance through affidavit. Similarly respondent 
may also file copies of all such documents which are available on the file of the 
trial court and on which they want to place reliance through affidavit.   
 
Upon consideration of the above judgment and order the Hon‟ble court has 
resolved to circulate the copy of the same among all the District and Sessions 
Judges with the request to kindly impress upon all the judicial offices working 
under their administrative control to follow strictly the instructions contained in the 
said judgment. Where record is required and called for, the same should be 
returned forthwith if the proceedings in the court below is not stayed. 
 
Therefore, enclosing herewith the copy of the above-mentioned judgment

CHAPTER-IX 
CRIMINAL CASES 
 
1. 
Bail 
 
(i) 
C.L. No. 32/Admin. ―G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 26-09-2013  
 
To decide applications for regular bail at the earliest in cases where interim 
bail has been granted.   
 
 
While enclosing herewith a copy of judgment and order dated 06.05.2013, 
passed by Hon‟ble Court (Hon‟ble Mr. Justice Kalimullah Khan) in Transfer 
Application (Criminal) NO. 160 of 2013 titled Km. Manisha Vs. State of U.P. & 
Another, I am directed to say that upon its consideration Hon‟ble Court has 
expressed its displeasure concerning delay in disposal of regular bail application 
and on extending interim bail unnecessarily again and again without any proper 
ground and sometimes even without appearance of the accused before court.  
Thus Hon‟ble Court has directed that in case an interim bail is granted in any 
matter, the court must not grant adjournment for disposal of such bail application 
except on very pressing grounds, for the  reasons to be recorded in writing and 
must dispose of the same at the earliest.  
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid instructions 
of the Hon‟ble Court to all the Judicial Officers working under your supervision 
and control for strict compliance of the order of Hon‟ble Court in letter and spirit.  
 
(ii) 
Strict compliance of the provisions of Section 437-A, Cr.P.C.  
 
C.L. No. 12/Admin. G-II dated: Allahabad 15.03.2013. 
 
 
The Hon‟ble Court (Hon‟ble Mr. Justice Ravindra Singh and Honn‟ble Mr. 
Justice Anil Kumar Agarwal) while hearing Criminal Appeal No. 2874 of 2011 
Santosh Vs. State of U.P. and another filed against the judgment and order dated 
8.3.2011 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Court No. 2, Mathura in 
sessions trial No. 374 of 2007 connected S.T. No. 374-A of 2007 and S.T. No. 355 
of 2007, noticed that the trial court had not obtained the bail bonds under Section 
437-A of Cr.P.C. of the accused who had been acquitted despite the said section 
having been come into force on2.11.2010, to ensure his appearance before the 
higher court as and when such court issued notice in respect of any appeal or 
petition. Therefore, deprecating the tendency of trial courts or appellate courts not 
obtaining the bail bonds of the accused to ensure their appearance before the higher 
50 
 
court as and when such court issued notice in respect of any appeal or petition, 
filed against the judgment of the respective courts, a direction has been issued for 
issuing a circular letter to all the District and Sessions Judges for ensuring strict 
compliance of the provisions of the above-mentioned section by all courts under 
their administrative control.  
   
Earlier a similar lapse, had been noticed by the Hon‟ble Court [Hon‟ble Mr. 
Justice Yatindra Singh and Hon‟ble Mr. Jusice Ram Surat Ram (Maurya)] in 
Criminal Appeal NO. 5201 of 2007 Nannu and others Vs. State of U.P., Criminal 
Appeal NO. 5929 of 2007, Lallu Vs. State of U.P. and Criminal Appeal No. 5985 
Gabbu Vs. State of U.P. along with te lacuna in the text of form No. 45 not being 
in consonance with the newly inserted provision mentioned in Section 437-A and 
vide judgment and order dated 13.2.2012 the Hon‟ble amended/modified the text 
of existing proforma as to bring it in conformity with the said section and left it to 
the discretion of Hon‟ble High Court on the administrative side to consider issuing 
a uniform format of the bail bonds in the light of newly added Section.  
 
Upon consideration of the said judgments and orders passed in the above 
mentioned Criminal appeals, the Hon‟ble Court has desired to make it imperative 
that, the trial court as well as the appellate court while deciding cases resulting in 
acquittal, must obtain bail bonds of the accused as well as of the sureties on 
prescribed proforma enclosed herewith for their appearance before the higher court 
as and when such court issues notice in respect of any appeal or petition filed 
against the judgment of the respective court in strict compliance of the provisions  
made in the section 437-A of Cr.P.C.  
 
Therefore, enclosing here with the copies of the judgments and orders 
passed in the above-mentioned criminal appeals and the modified proforma of 
form No. 45 (both English and Hindi version), I am to request you to kindly 
impress upon all the Judicial Officers under your administrative control to adhere 
to the directions mentioned therein in letter and spirit and use the aforesaid 
proforma in the light of the provisions in Section 476 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure.                                       
As enclosed.

2. 
RELEASE ORDER 
 
(i) 
Compliance of the direction given by Hon‘ble High Court in Criminal 
Appeal No. 4072 of 2005, Chandrama @ Magram Yadav & Another vs. 
State.  
 
C.L. No. 03/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 16.01.2013 
 
 
In continuation of C.L. No. 114/VIIb-47 of 1978, C.L. No. 124 of 1979 and 
C.L. No. 73 of 1982, I am directed to say that it is the duty of the officer to fill up 
all required information in a release order instead of asking a convicted person who 
is in prison or his pairokars to put down all details in the release order which is to 
be issued by the Court. The release order must contain every detail for reference or 
proper identification purposes when being sent to the Jail Superintendent. Thus it is 
directed by Hon‟ble Court that all the courts of the State which are issuing the 
release orders or which are likely to issue release orders, they must incorporate all 
the details as per above mentioned circular letters.  
 
Hon‟ble Court has also expressed its anguish over increasing number of 
correction applications being filed in the High Court due to some subordinate 
courts insisting upon the pairokars of prisoners to get full description of offences, 
crime number and Section of I.P.C. and other Acts incorporated in the bail orders 
which are being passed by Hon‟ble Court in spite of a Case No. or S.T. No. of the 
trial court having been mentioned in them for proper reference and identification.  
 
Thus it is directed by Hon‟ble Court that if there is sufficient reference of the 
concerned case or S.T. No. in which bail is being granted by this Court any 
insistence on the part of courts below for also getting other details incorporated in 
the bail order, canot be held to be justified. From the reference of the Case/S.T. 
Number other details can be ascertained by the subordinate courts from their own 
record which normally remains available with them and in case any uncertainty 
still exists in the mind of any Presiding Officer he may ask for any other 
information to be furnished by the applicant instead of rejecting his application for 
want of those details in the bail order of the Court and forcing him to get the same 
corrected.  
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate above mentioned judgment 
dated 12.09.2012 (copy enclosed herewith) passed in Criminal Appeal No. 4072 of 
54 
 
2005, Chandrama @ Magram Yadav & Another Vs. State, amongst all the Judicial 
Officers working under your supervision and control for their guidance and 
necessary compliance.

PRIVILEGES OF LEGISLATURES 
 
(i) 
Compliance of the direction given by Hon‘ble Supreme Court vide 
order dated 10.03.2014, in Criminal Misc. Case No. 536 of 2011- Public 
Interest Foundation & Ors. vs. Union of India & Anr. 
 
C.L. No.17/Admin.‘G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 04.07.2014 
 
 
Keeping in view, the growing criminalization in politics due to long delay in 
trials, Hon‟ble Apex Court in above-noted case, has directed that in relation to 
sitting MPs and MLAs who have charged framed against them for the offences 
which are specified in Section 8(1), 8(2) and 8(3) of Representation of the People 
Act, 1951, the trial shall be concluded as speedily and expeditiously as may be 
possible and in no case later than one year from the date of the framing of 
charge(s). 
 
In such cases, as far as possible, the trial shall be conducted on a day-to-day 
basis. 
 
If for some extraordinary circumstances the concerned court is being not 
able to conclude the trial within one year from the date of framing of charge(s), the 
court concerned shall submit the report to the Hon‟ble Chief Justice, explaining 
those special reasons clearly for which the above time limit could not be adhered to 
and the conclusion of the trial was delayed so that Hon‟ble The Chief Justice may 
issue appropriate directions to the court concerned for extending the time for 
conclusion of the trial. 
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid direction of 
the Hon‟ble Court to all the Judicial Officers working under your supervision and 
control for their information and necessary compliance. 
 
(ii) 
Compliance of the direction given by Hon‘ble Supreme Court vide 
order dated 10.03.2014, in Writ Petition (Civil) NO. 536 of 2011- Public 
Interest Foundation & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Anr.  
 
C.L. No. 02/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: 06.01.2015 
 
In continuation of Court‟s earlier Circular Letter No. 17 dated 04.07.2014 
regarding expeditious disposal of cases in relation to sitting MPs and MLAs who 
55 
 
have charges framed against them for the offences which are specified in Section 
8(1), 8(2) and 8(3) of Representation of the People Act, 1951, I am directed to say 
that the Ministry of Home Affairs Government of India has requested the State 
Governments to direct the Directorate of Prosecution to identify such cases and to 
move an application before the Judicial Magistrate/Session Judge concerned 
through the Public Prosecutor to seek their trial on day to day basis in compliance 
of the directions of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the subject Writ Petition.  
Reiterating the directions of Court‟s earlier Circular Letter no. 17 dated 
04.07.2014, I am further directed to say that the District Judge concerned shall 
personally monitor to ensure disposing of such cases in no case later than one year 
from the date of framing of charge(s) under the intimation of this Court.  
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid directions of 
the Hon‟ble Court to all the Judicial Offices working under your supervision and 
control and to ensure strict compliance.

MEDICO LEGAL REPORT 
(i) 
Forensic Science Laboratory 
 
Compliance of the order dated 20.01.2014 passed by Hon‘ble Supreme Court 
in Criminal Appeal No. 259 of 2009, titled Joshinder Yadav vs. State of Bihar. 
 
C.L. No.14/Admin. G-II dated: Allahabad 27.05.2014. 
 
 
While deciding the above mentioned Criminal Appeal (copy of the judgment 
enclosed herewith), Hon‟ble the Supreme Court has noticed that in several cases 
where poisoning is suspected, the prosecuting agencies are not taking steps to 
obtain viscera report. In this regard Hon‟ble Supreme Court has directed that in 
such cases immediately after the post-mortem, the viscera should be sent to the 
Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL). The prosecuting agencies should ensure that 
the viscera, in fact, is sent to the FSL for examination and the FSL should ensure 
that the viscera is examined immediately and the report is sent to the investigating 
agencies/court post haste. If the viscera report is not received the concerned court 
must ask for explanation and must summon the concerned officer of the FSL to 
give an explanation as to why the viscera report is not forwarded to the 
investigating agency/court. The court must ensure that it is brought on record. 
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid 
judgment/order of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, to all the Judicial Officers working 
under you supervision and control, highlighting those aspects which require 
compliance by them.

and others regarding expeditious disposal of final reports.  
 
C.L. No. 31 /2012/Admin. ‗G-II‘ dated: Allahabad 11.12.2012. 
 
The Hon‟ble court (Hon‟ble Mr. Justice Sudhir Kumar Saxena) while 
dealing with the Criminal Misc. Case No. 2520 of 2012 (482 Cr.PC)- Pradeep 
Kumar Shrivastava v. State of Uttar Pradesh and others came across shocking 
pendency of final reports owing to indifference on the part of Magistrates and has

under them to dispose of the final reports pending before them on priority basis, if 
possible, within the period of 3 months from the date of their submission and 
further directed that the Sessions Judges may impress upon the Chief Judicial 
Magistrates and other Magistrates to first priorities those cases chronologically the 
older getting precedence over the subsequently filed cases, lying further stress 
upon monitoring of the service of notice upon the informants in the monthly 
monitoring cell meetings with a view to ensuring that the cases in which the parties 
were served, were not adjourned in routine manner.

made by such witness or victim, allow any particular person to remain 
present in court room.  
(iii) The statement of a lady witness, if she wishes, may be recorded in the 
presence of a person (preferably a female) of her wish/choice so that she 
may feel secured.  
 
 
I am, therefore, to request you to circulate above-mentioned guidelines to all 
the judicial officers working your supervision and control for information and strict 
compliance.   
 
(ii) 
Directions in connection with recording evidence of a medical 
practitioner 
 
Order dated 18.10.2010 passed by Hon‘ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal 
No. 8981 of 2010 (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 10383 of 2007) titled Raj Kumar 
v. Ajay Kumar & Anr. 
C.L. No. 20/ Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 26.08.2016 
Reiterating the marginally quoted G.L. and Circular Letters and referring to the 
above-mentioned order of Hon‟ble Apex Court, I am 
directed to apprise you the following directions in 
connection with recording of evidence of medical 
practitioners: 
1. Efforts should be made to record the evidence 
of the treating Doctors on commission, after 
ascertaining their convenient timings. 
2. If the Doctors attend the Court for giving 
evidence, their evidence may be recorded without 
delay, ensuring that they are not required to wait. 
3. The Doctors may be given specific time for 
attending the court for giving evidence instead of 
1. G.L. No. 7/VIIIa-5 Dated 
7th August, 1951 
2. C.L. No. 45/ VIII a-5 Dated 
24th March, 1971 
3. C.L. No. 82/ VII b-52 
Dated 23rd  September, 1968 
4. C.L. No. 19/ VIII a-84 
Dated 24th April, 1967 
5.  C.L. No. 5 Dated 16th 
January, 1965 read with  
6. C.L. No. 53/ VII-6-52 
Dated 4th October, 1960 
7. C.L. No. 88/ VIII b-52 
Dated 4th November, 1980 
58 
 
requiring them to come at 10.30 am or 11 am and wait in the Court Hall. 
They may be summoned to attend at a time when the court thinks it will be 
able to examine them keeping in mind the convenience of the doctors.  
4. Steps should also be taken that that Medical Practitioners do not have to wait 
standing outside the courtroom for want of furniture. 
5. In cases where the certificates are not contested by the respondents, they 
may be marked by consent, thereby dispensing with the oral evidence. 
6. While issuing summons to a Medical Practitioner full particulars of the case 
in which he is to be examined should be furnished by the court concerned so 
as to enable him to come prepared with the case. 
7. The Medical Practitioner should be relieved as soon as practicable to avoid 
dislocation of his work. 
8. Frequent summoning of a Medical Practitioner and that too at short notice 
shall be avoided as far as possible. 
9. The summons to the Government Doctors should be routed through the 
Chief Medical Officer of the district and should be issued well in advance so 
as to reach at least a week before. 
I am, therefore, directed to request you to circulate a copy of the instant 
Circular Letter amongst all the Judicial Officers working under your supervision 
and control and to ensure compliance of the same in letter and spirit. 
 
7. 
CASES OF JUVENILE 
 
(i) 
Regular visit of Presiding Juvenile Board Magistrates from the other 
 
districts whose children are lodged in the home in another district. 
 
C.L. No. 16/Admin. G-II dated: Allahabad 26.07.2013 
 
 
I am directed to say that Hon‟ble Court has resolved that the Magistrates 
presiding the Juvenile Justice Board of the district where the observation Home is 
located shall visit Home once in a month and draft an inspection memo, while the 
Magistrates presiding Juvenile Justice Board of neighbouring districts from where 
the Juveniles are lodged in Observation Home of other district shall visit officially 
such Home quarterly to supervise upkeep of the inmates belonging to their districts 
preferably on a day when the court is not functioning and draft an inspection memo 
so that he can obtain first hand information of the children belonging to his district 
in that Juvenile Home and can address their problems, and also make suggestions 
for the better running of the Home.  
59 
 
 
I am, therefore to request you to circulate instructions to the Magistrates 
presiding the Juvenile Justice Board of your district to comply with the above-said 
directions of Hon‟ble Court in letter and spirit.  
 
(ii) 
Regarding use of the provisions under Section 309 and 327 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure during the trial of cases involving heinous crimes 
such as rape. 
 
C.L. No. 09, Main-B/Admin.(A-3): Allahabad: Dated: 08/3/2013 
 
I have been directed to draw your attention to the use of the provisions under 
Section 309 and 327 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since the general 
impression has been that even in the trial of accused involved in heinous crimes, 
these provisions are not being invoked and used, as scrupulously as they should be. 
Instead, adjournments are being given even in trial of such serious cases at par with 
other cases as a norm.  
Therefore your are suggested to adhere to these provisions in trial of cases 
involving heinous crimes such as rape. This has become imperative as continuing 
delay in dispensation of justice in such cases, may erode the faith of people in the 
credibility of criminal justice system. The need of the hour then is to respond by 
conducting trials without adjournment as far as possible and by bringing culprits to 
justice in the shortest possible time.  
 
(iii) 
Compliance of the direction given by Hon‘ble High Court in Criminal 
Appeal No. 4072 of 2005, Chandrama @ Magram Yadav & Another Vs. 
State.  
  
C.L. No. 03/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 16.01.2013. 
 
 
 
In continuation of C.L. No. 114/VIIb-47 of 1978, C.L. No. 124 of 1979 and 
C.L. No. 73 of 1982, I am directed to say that it is the duty of the officer to fill up 
all required information in a release order instead of asking a convicted person who 
is in prison or his pairokars to put down all details in the release order which is to 
be issued by the Court. The release order must contain every detail for reference or 
proper identification purposes when being sent to the Jail Superintendent. Thus it is 
directed by Hon‟ble Court that all the courts of the State which are issuing the 
release orders or which are likely to issue release orders, they must incorporate all 
the details as per above mentioned circular letters.  
60 
 
 
Hon‟ble Court has also expressed its anguish over increasing number of 
correction applications being filed in the High Court due to some subordinate 
courts insisting upon the pairokars of prisoners to get full description of offences, 
crime number and Section of I.P.C. and other Acts incorporated in the bail orders 
which are being passed by Hon‟ble Court in spite of a Case No. or S.T. No. of the 
trial court having been mentioned in them for proper reference and identification.  
 
Thus it is directed by Hon‟ble Court that if there is sufficient reference of the 
concerned case or S.T. No. in which bail is being granted by this Court any 
insistence on the part of courts below for also getting other details incorporated in 
the bail order, cannot be held to be justified. From the reference of the Case/S.T. 
No., other details can be ascertained by the subordinate courts from their own 
record which normally remains available with them and in case any uncertainty 
still exists in the mind of any Presiding Officer he may ask for any other 
information to be furnished by the applicant instead of rejecting his application for 
want of those details in the bail order of the Court and forcing him to get the same 
corrected.  
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate above mentioned judgment 
dated 12.09.2012 (copy enclosed herewith) passed in Criminal Appeal No. 4072 of 
2005, Chandrama @ Magram Yadav & Another Vs. State, amongst all the Judicial 
Officers working under your supervision and control for their guidance and 
necessary compliance.  
 
(iv) 
Compliance of the direction given by Hon‘ble Supreme Court vide 
order dated 10.03.2014, in Criminal Misc. Case No. 536 of 2011- Public 
Interest Foundation & Ors. vs. Union of India & Anr. 
 
C.L. No.17/Admin.‘G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 04.07.2014 
 
 
Keeping in view, the growing criminalization in politics due to long delay in 
trials, Hon‟ble Apex Court in above-noted case, has directed that in relation to 
sitting MPs and MLAs who have charged framed against them for the offences 
which are specified in Section 8(1), 8(2) and 8(3) of Representation of the People 
Act, 1951, the trial shall be concluded as speedily and expeditiously as may be 
possible and in no case later than one year from the date of the framing of 
charge(s). 
 
In such cases, as far as possible, the trial shall be conducted on a day-to-day 
basis. 
 
If for some extraordinary circumstances the concerned court is being not 
able to conclude the trial within one year from the date of framing of charge(s), the 
court concerned shall submit the report to the Hon‟ble Chief Justice, explaining 
61 
 
those special reasons clearly for which the above time limit could not be adhered to 
and the conclusion of the trial was delayed so that Hon‟ble The Chief Justice may 
issue appropriate directions to the court concerned for extending the time for 
conclusion of the trial. 
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid direction of 
the Hon‟ble Court to all the Judicial Officers working under your supervision and 
control for their information and necessary compliance. 
 
(v) 
Compliance of the order dated 20.01.2014 passed by Hon‘ble Supreme 
Court in Criminal Appeal No. 259 of 2009, titled Joshinder Yadav Vs. 
State of Bihar. 
 
C.L. No.14/Admin. G-II dated :Allahabad 27.05.2014 
 
 
While deciding the above mentioned Criminal Appeal (copy of the judgment 
enclosed herewith), Hon‟ble the Supreme Court has noticed that in several cases 
where poisoning is suspected, the prosecuting agencies are not taking steps to 
obtain viscera report. In this regard Hon‟ble Supreme Court has directed that in 
such cases immediately after the post-mortem, the viscera should be sent to the 
Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL). The prosecuting agencies should ensure that 
the viscera, in fact, is sent to the FSL for examination and the FSL should ensure 
that the viscera is examined immediately and the report is sent to the investigating 
agencies/court post haste. If the viscera report is not received the concerned court 
must ask for explanation and must summon the concerned officer of the FSL to 
give an explanation as to why the viscera report is not forwarded to the 
investigating agency/court. The court must ensure that it is brought on record. 
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid 
judgment/order of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, to all the Judicial Officers working 
under you supervision and control, highlighting those aspects which require 
compliance by them. 
 
(vi) 
Compliance of order dated 18.12.2013, passed by Hon‘ble Court in 
Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 1140 of 2013 titled Pappu Yadav @ 
Bhoo Prakash Vs. State of U.P. & Others. 
 
C.L. No.09/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 21.03.2014 
 
 
While enclosing herewith a Photostat copy of order dated 18.12.2013, 
passed by Hon‟ble Court in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 1140 of 2013 titled 
Pappu Yadav @ Bhoo Prakash Vs. State of U.P. & Others and while referring to 
62 
 
the judgment delivered by Hon‟ble Court in Shiv Prasad Vs. State of U.P. And 
another, report in UP 1991 (28) ACC 487 and in Sahab Singh Vs. State of U.P. 
reported in 2003 (46) ACC 157 I am directed to state that Hon‟ble Court has taken 
a serious note of the fact of not following the ratio laid down by the Court in above 
mentioned cases by the lower appellate courts and continuously deciding the 
appeals under Section 72(2) of U.P. Act No. IV of 1910 as criminal appeals against 
confiscation order. 
 
Hon‟ble Court has directed in this regard to comply with the Govt. 
Notification NO. 4986 (E)/XIII-157, dated June 4, 1978 published in U.P. 
Gazette (Extra.) dated 4th June 1978 (enclosed herewith) and the judicial 
pronouncement made by the Hon‟ble Court to register and decide the appeal 
against confiscation order, under Section 72(7) of the U.P. Act No. IV of 1910 as a 
civil appeal and not as a criminal appeal. Hon‟ble Court has also desired in this 
regard that endeavour should preferably be made to decide these appeals by the 
District Judge himself. 
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid 
judgment/order of the Hon‟ble Court, to all the Judicial Officers working under 
your supervision and control, highlighting those aspects which require compliance 
by them.

EXPEDITIONUS DISPOSAL 
 
(i) 
Fast tracking of cases relating to women, juvenile and Prevention of 
Corruption Act, 1988. 
 
C.L. No. 23/Admin. G-II dated: Allahabad 22.08.2013. 
 
 
 
A serious concern has been shown by the Hon‟ble Apex Court over the 
mounting pendency of cases relating to offences against women, juveniles and 
64 
 
covered under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 over a period of time, may 
be due to lack of deterrent effect on account of slow place of grinding of wheels of 
justice. An effective and expeditious dispensation justice would go a long way in 
arresting not only the arrears of cases but in alleviating the affliction of society 
from crime against women and children which otherwise would have a deleterious 
effect. Corruption is a malady which calls for preventive, punitive and reformatory 
approach. The punitive action against the guilty protects the society from potential 
offenders. Modern civil society is in great need of corruption free society, therefore 
delay in disposal of these cases would not help in arresting this evil.  
 
Therefore, upon consideration of the matter, the Hon‟ble court has desired 
that the cases relating to crime against women, juveniles and covered under the 
Prevention of Corruption Act be fast tracked and be taken up for hearing and 
disposal on priority basis.  
 
I am therefore to request you to kindly direct the officers under your 
administrative control to take up the cases of the above category for hearing on 
priority basis and fast track their disposal.  
 
I am further directed to request you to kindly send a consolidated monthly 
report of your judgeship regarding pendency and disposal of the cases of above 
nature every month which must reach the Hon‟ble court by 7th day of the month 
following for being submitted to the Hon‟ble apex court. The 1st such report must 
reach court from the month of August which should reach by 7th day in the month 
of September positively.  
 
Kindly treat this as most urgent.

(iii) 
Compliance of guidelines/Judgment of Hon‘ble Supreme Court passed 
in Criminal Appeal No. 1758 of 2011- Raghuvansh Dewanchand Bhasin 
v. State of Maharashtra & Anr. Regarding guidelines by Court 
 
C.L. No. 06/201/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: 19.01.2012 
 
I am, directed to inform you that Hon‟ble the Supreme Court, in the 
captioned matter, has framed following guidelines to be adopted in all cases where 
no-bailable warrants are issued by the Courts:- 
The Guidelines 
(a) All the High Court shall ensure that the Subordinate Courts use printed and 
machine numbered Form No. 2 for issuing warrant of arrest and each such 
form is duly accounted for, 
(b) Before authenticating the Court must ensure that complete particulars of the 
case are mentioned on the warrant; 
(c) The presiding Judge of the court (or responsible officer specially authorized 
for the purpose in case of High Court) issuing the warrant should put his full 
and legible signatures on the process, also ensuring that Court seal bearing 
complete particulars of the Court is prominently endorsed thereon; 
(d) The court must ensure that warrant is directed to a particular police officer 
(of authority) and, unless intended to be open-ended, it must be returnable 
whether executed or unexecuted, on or before the date specified therein; 
(e) Every Court must maintain a register (in the format given below), in which 
each warrant of arrest issued must be entered chronologically and the serial 
number of such entry reflected on the top right hand of the process; 
(f) No warrant of arrest shall be issued without being entered in the register 
mentioned above and the concerned court shall periodically check/monitor 
the same to confirm that every such process is always returned to the court 
with due report and placed on the record of the concerned case; 
(g) A register similar to the one in clause (e) supra shall be maintained at the 
concerned police station. The Station House Officer of the concerned Police 
Station shall ensure that each warrant of arrest issued by the Court, when 
received is duty entered in the said register and is formally entrusted to a 
66 
 
responsible officer for execution; 
(h) Ordinarily, the Courts should not give a long time for return of execution of 
warrants, as experience has shown that warrants are prone to misuse if they 
remain in control of executing agencies for long; 
(i) On the date fixed for the return of the warrant, the Court must insist upon a 
compliance report on the action taken thereon by the Station House Officer 
of the Concerned Police Station of the Officer-incharge of the concerned 
agency; 
(j) The report on such warrants must be clear, cogent and legible and duly 
forwarded by a superior police officer, so as to facilitate fixing or 
responsibility in case of misuse; 
(k)  In the event of warrant for execution beyond jurisdiction of the Court 
issuing it, procedure laid down in Sections 78 and 79 of the Code must be 
strictly and scrupulously followed; and  
(l) In the event of cancellation of the arrest warrant by the Court, the order 
cancelling warrant shall be recorded in the case file and the register 
maintained. A copy thereof shall be sent to the concerned authority, 
requiring the process to be retuned unexecuted forthwith. The date of receipt 
of the unexecuted warrant will be entered in the aforesaid register. A copy of 
such order shall also be supplied to the accused.

(iv) 
Compliance of the directions given by Hon‘ble Court in Criminal 
Appeal no. 6776 of 2007- Ajant Singh Vs. State of U.P. in respect of 
putting number of cases of special category like Gangster Act, SC & ST 
Act etc. and adopting correct procedure in initiations of proceedings 
under Section 446 Cr. PC. 
 
C.L. No. 05/ 2012/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated 16.1.2012. 
 
While deciding the above noted Criminal Appeal no. 6776 of 2007 Ajant 
Singh V. State of U.P. the Hon‟ble Court has noticed that different practice is 
being followed in different Judgeship for putting number of cases like Gangster 
Act, SC & ST Act etc. and also that the Subordinate Courts are not following the 
correct procedure while initiating th3e proceedings under Section 446 of Cr. PC for 
recovery of the amount after forfeiture. It has been desired by the Hon‟ble Court 
that uniform practice be followed throughout the entire State. With above object in 
mind the Hon‟ble Court has observed that there are two types of Criminal cases 
which are to be tried by the Sessions Judge including Additional Sessions Judge 
and Special Judge. The First category of cases are Sessions trial under the 
Provisions of Indian Penal Code committed to the Court of Sessions by the 
Magistrate under the provisions of Section 209 Code of Cr. PC and in the second 
category there are cases which are to be tried under the provisions of enactment of 
the State Government and Central Government by which the cases are being filed 
directly before designated Special Judge like the Gangster Act/ SC & ST cases, 
Electricity Cases etc. The cases which are committed by the Magistrate are to be 
received in the officer Sessions Judge and all the cases which are committed to the 
court of Sessions are numbered in register maintained by the Sessions Judge 
whereas the cases of special category are not to be received in the officer of the 
Sessions Judge, but are to be received by the office of Special Judge (Gangster/SC 
& ST Act etc.) and these cases of special category which are not received after 
committal must be numbered as criminal cases and which are not received after 
committal must be numbered as criminal cases and not the Sessions trial. The 
procedure of Sessions trial and criminal cases is also different.  
The Hon‟ble Court further observed that most of the judicial officers are not 
following the correct procedure after forfeiture of the bail bonds and they are not 
putting separate number of misc. criminal cases while initiating proceedings under 
Section 446 Cr. PC for recovery of the amount of bail bonds and some of the 
judicial officers continue to pass orders regarding the recovery of amount under 
Section 446 Cr.PC in the file of Sessions trial. Whereas the law and rules provide 
that the proceedings under Section 446 Cr.PC must be registered separately and 
separate number must be put to such proceedings. It is highly improper to continue 
68 
 
recovery proceedings under Section 446 Cr.PC in the file of Sessions trial without 
putting separate misc. number of such file.    
In view of the above observations of Hon‟ble Court, I am directed to 
communicate that from now onwards all the cases pertaining to special category 
such as Gangster/SC& ST Act etc. shall not be registered as Sessions trial rather 
such cases shall be registered as „Special Criminal Cases‟ so as to distinguish them 
from such category of cases which are being received after committal and further 
in drawing proceedings under Section 446 Cr.P.C., every such proceedings shall be 
registered as a separate misc. case.  
Therefore, while enclosing a copy of the above noted judgment I am to 
request you to kindly bring the contents of this Circular letter to the notice of all 
the judicial officers working in the judgeship under your administrative control and 
to ensure that the direction given above are strictly followed by them.

appropriate action under Sub-Section (2).

While enclosing herewith a Photostat copy of order dated 18.12.2013, 
passed by Hon‟ble Court in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 1140 of 2013 titled 
Pappu Yadav @ Bhoo Prakash Vs. State of U.P. & Others and while referring to 
the judgment delivered by Hon‟ble Court in Shiv Prasad Vs. State of U.P. And 
another, report in UP 1991 (28) ACC 487 and in Sahab Singh Vs. State of U.P. 
reported in 2003 (46) ACC 157 I am directed to state that Hon‟ble Court has taken 
a serious note of the fact of not following the ratio laid down by the Court in above 
mentioned cases by the lower appellate courts and continuously deciding the 
appeals under Section 72(2) of U.P. Act No. IV of 1910 as criminal appeals against 
confiscation order. 
 
Hon‟ble Court has directed in this regard to comply with the Govt. 
Notification NO. 4986 (E)/XIII-157, dated June 4, 1978 published in U.P. 
Gazette (Extra.) dated 4th June 1978 (enclosed herewith) and the judicial 
pronouncement made by the Hon‟ble Court to register and decide the appeal 
against confiscation order, under Section 72(7) of the U.P. Act No. IV of 1910 as a 
civil appeal and not as a criminal appeal. Hon‟ble Court has also desired in this 
regard that endeavour should preferably be made to decide these appeals by the 
District Judge himself. 
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid 
judgment/order of the Hon‟ble Court, to all the Judicial Officers working under 
your supervision and control, highlighting those aspects which require compliance 
by them. 
 
(vii) Compliance of guidelines/orders of Hon‘ble Supreme Court passed in 
Criminal Appeal No. 963 of 2010- Damodar S. Parabhu v. Sayed 
Babalal H. 
C.L. No. 04/2012/ Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 16.01.2012. 
I am directed to inform you that Hon‟ble the Supreme Court, in the 
captioned matter, has framed following guidelines for a graded scheme of 
imposing costs on parties who unduly delay compounding of the offences as 
contemplated by Section 147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 
“the Act”) and also directed for controlling the filing of multiple complaints that 
are relatable to the same transaction under Section 138 of the Act:- 
The Guidelines 
(a) That directions can be given that the Writ of Summons be suitably modified 
making it clear to the accused that he could make an application for 
compounding of the offences at the first of second hearing of the case and 
that if such an application is made, compounding may be allowed by the 
court without imposing any costs on the accused.   
(b) If the accused does not made an application for compounding as aforesaid 
70 
 
then if an application for compounding is made before the Magistrate at a 
subsequent stage, compounding can be allowed subject to the condition that 
the accused will be required to pay 10% of the cheque amount to be 
deposited as a condition for compounding with the Legal Services Authority, 
or such authority as the Court deems fit.  
(c) Similarly, if the application for compounding is made before the Sessions 
Courts or a High Court in revision or appeal, such compounding may be 
allowed on the condition that the accused pays 15% of the cheque amount by 
way of costs.  
(d) Finally, if the application for compounding is made before the Supreme 
Court, the figure would increase of 20% of the cheque amount. 
Let it also be clarified that any costs imposed in accordance with these 
guidelines should be deposited with the Legal Services Authority operating 
at the level of the Court before which compounding take place. For instance, 
in case of compounding during the pendency of proceedings before a 
Magistrate‟s Court or a Court of Sessions, such costs should be deposited 
with the District Legal Services Authority. Likewise, costs imposed in 
connection with composition before the High Court should be deposited 
with the State Legal Services Authority and those impose in connection with 
composition before the Supreme Court should be deposited with the 
National Legal Services Authority. 
 
Therefore, while enclosing herewith a copy of the Order dated 03.05.2010 
passed by the Hon‟ble Apex Court in the above mentioned case you are requested 
to kindly circulate this circular letter to all the Judicial Officers under you 
supervision and control for their information and necessary compliance. 
 
(viii) Compliance of the direction given by Hon‘ble High Court in Criminal 
Misc. (P.I.L.) Writ Petition No. 1797 of 2011- Mohammad Qasim Vs. Union of 
India and others  
C.L. No. 18/Admin. ‗G-II‘  Dated: Allahabad 27-04-2011 
 
While enclosing herewith a copy of the order passed in the aforesaid Writ 
Petition, I am directed to communicate you that the direction contained in the order 
of Hon‟ble High Court, be complied forthwith. 
 
I am further directed to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid 
Judgment/order of the Court to all the Judicial Officers working under your 
supervision and control for their guidance and necessary compliance.

Justice Gyan Sudha Misra) in Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 9507 of 2010 
(entitled Rajbir @ Raju & Another Vs. State of Haryana), I am directed to say that 
the Hon‟ble Supreme Court has directed to ordinarily add section 302 I.P.C. to the 
charge of section 304-B I.P.C. So that death sentence can be imposed in such 
heinous and barbaric crimes against women. 
 
I am, therefore, to request you to circulate the circular letter and copy of 
Judgment/Order of Hon‟ble the Supreme Court to all the Judicial Officers under 
your administrative control for their information & guidance.

CRIME AGAINST WOMEN 
 
(i) 
Compliance of the direction given by Hon‘ble Supreme Court in Writ 
Petition (Civil) No. 559 of 1994 – R.D. Upadhyay Vs. State of A.P. and 
others. 
 
C.L. No. 44/Admin. ―G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 07.12.2013 
 
 
While enclosing herewith a copy of the order dated 01.08.2013 passed by 
Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 559 of 1994 titled R.D. 
Upadhyay Vs. State of A.P. & Ors., I am directed to say that Hon‟ble Apex Court 
has expressed deep concern over the plight of women under trial prisoners and that 
of their children languishing in various jails with their mothers. Hon‟ble Apex 
Court has directed to impress upon all the courts of the country dealing with cases 
of women prisoners whose children are in prison with their mothers to give priority 
to such cases and to decide their cases expeditiously.  
 
Hon‟ble Court has directed in this regard that the District & Sessions Judge 
shall obtain quarterly returns from the Jail Superintendent in regard to number of 
women convicts who are lodged in jail either with children or without children 
mentioning the age of the child. The District Judges should ensure that on receipt 
of information necessary steps are taken for expeditious disposal of cases by 
informing the courts where these cases are pending.   
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly issue necessary directions along 
with the aforesaid Judgment and order of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court to all the 
72 
 
Judicial Officers working under you supervision and control to give priority to 
cases of women prisoners whose children are in prison with their mother and to 
decide such cases expeditiously.   
 
(ii) 
Regarding use of the provisions under Section 309 and 327 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure during the trial of cases involving heinous crimes 
such as rape. 
 
C.L. No. 09, Main-B/Admin.(A-3): Allahabad: Dated: 08.3.2013 
 
I have been directed to draw your attention to the use of the provisions under 
Section 309 and 327 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since the general 
impression has been that even in the trial of accused involved in heinous crimes, 
these provisions are not being invoked and used, as scrupulously as they should be. 
Instead, adjournments are being given even in trial of such serious cases at par with 
other cases as a norm.  
Therefore your are suggested to adhere to these provisions in trial of cases 
involving heinous crimes such as rape. This has become imperative as continuing 
delay in dispensation of justice in such cases, may erode the faith of people in the 
credibility of criminal justice system. The need of the hour then is to respond by 
conducting trials without adjournment as far as possible and by bringing culprits to 
justice in the shortest possible time.  
 
 
(iii) 
Strict compliance of Sec. 309 of Cr.P.C. 
C.L. No. 20/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 04.05.2015  
 
 
 
In continuation of marginally quoted Court‟s earlier Circular Letters and in 
the light of Hon‟ble Apex Court‟s orders passed in the cases of 
Akil alias Javed VS. State of NCT of Delhi, reported in 2012 
(11) SCALE 709, in paras 27 to 36: State of UP Vs. Shambhu 
Nath Singh and others, reported in 2001 (4) SCC 667; Raj Deo 
Sharma Vs. State of Bihar, 1999 Cr.L.J. 4541 and Lt. Col. SJ. 
Chaudhari Vs. State (Delhi) Administration, (1984) 1 SCC 722, 
I am directed to state that the High Court is noticing disturbing 
trend in criminal trials, where Sessions cases are being 
adjourned, in some cases to suit convenience of counsels or because the 
prosecution or the defence is not fully ready and considers it necessary to draw the 
attention of all the Sessions Judges and Additional Sessions Judges once again to 
the provision of Section 309 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and directs 
1. C.L. No. 152/VIII-b-

73 
 
them to adhere strictly to these provisions and instructions given below while 
granting adjournment in Sessions Cases:  
(1) 
 Trial Judges are reminded of the need to comply with Section 309 of the 
Code in letter and spirit.  
(2) 
In every inquiry or trial the proceedings shall be held as expeditiously as 
possible, and in particular, when the examination of witnesses has once 
begun, the same shall be continued from day to day until all the witnesses in 
attendance have been examined, unless the court finds the adjournment of 
the same beyond the following day to be necessary for reasons to be 
recorded: (Section 309 (1) Cr.P.C.]  
(3) 
 When the inquiry or trial relates to an offence under Sections 376 to 376D 
of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the inquiry or trial shall, as far as 
possible, be completed within a period of two months from the date of 
commencement of the examination of witnesses. (Vide amendment by Act 
No. 5 of 2009 effective from 31.12.2009). 
(4) 
(a) No adjournment shall be granted for the purpose only of enabling the 
accused person to show cause against the sentence proposed to be imposed 
on him. (vide Act No. 45 of 1978, effective from 18.12.1978). 
(b) 
 No adjournment shall be granted at the request of a party, except 
where the circumstances are beyond the control of that arty; 
(c) 
The fact that the pleader of a party is engaged in another Court, shall 
not be a ground for adjournment: 
(d) 
where a witness is present in Court but a Party or his pleader is not 
present or the party or his pleader though present in Court, is not ready to 
examine or cross examine the witness, the Court may, if thinks fit, record the 
statement of the witness and pass such orders as it think fit dispensing with 
the examination in chief or cross-examination of the witness, as the case 
may be (vide amendment by Act No. 5 of 2009, effective from 1.11.2010). 
(5) 
Adjournment or postponement can only be made, in a proper case, on 
payment of sufficient costs on the party seeking the adjournment. When 
examination of witnesses h as begun and the witnesses are in attendance, the trial 
may be adjourned without examining the witnesses only for special reasons (i.e. 
for exceptional and not ordinary reasons) to be recorded in writing.   
(6) 
The terms on which an adjournment or postponement may be granted 
include, in appropriate cases, the payment of costs by the prosecution or the 
accused. Strict action is to be taken against the defaulting party in case the trial is 
not conducted as expeditiously as possible, including by cancelling the bail of the 
accused or by imposing heavy costs commensurate with the loss of earning of the 
witness who appears for giving evidence ein the case, and especially when the 
examination of the witnesses has once begun, the same has to be carried out on a 
74 
 
day to day basis unless all the witnesses in attendance are examined and unless the 
Court finds the adjournment of the same beyond the following day to be necessary 
for reasons to be recorded for a period it considers reasonable, and may by a 
warrant remand the accused if in custody for a period not exceeding fifteen days. 
(See explanation  2 to section 309 & Akil alias Javed Vs. State of NCT of Delhi, 
reported in 2012 (11) SCALE 709, in paras 27 to 36, State of U.P. Vs. Shambhu 
Nath Singh and others, reported in 2001 (4) SCC 667; Raj Deo Sharma Vs. State of 
Bihar, 1999Cr.L.J. 4541 and Lt. Col. S.J. Chaudhari Vs. State (Delhi) 
Administration, (1984) 1 SCC 722.   
(7) 
Sessions cases should be disposed of within one year of their institution, the 
date of commitment being taken as the date of institution Cases pending for longer 
periods should be regarded as old cases in respect of which explanations should be 
furnished in the calendar statements and in the periodical returns.  
(8) 
Sessions cases should be given precedence over all other work and no other 
work should be taken up on session‟s days until the sessions work for the day is 
completed. If for any reason, a case has to be adjourned or postponed, intimation 
should be given forthwith to both sides and immediate steps be taken to stop the 
witnesses and to secure their presence on the adjourned date.  
(9) 
On receipt of the order of commitment the case should be posted for trial to 
as early a date as possible, sufficient time, say three weeks, being allowed for 
securing the witnesses. Sufficient time should be allowed for each case so that one 
case does not telescope into the next. Every endeavour should be made to avoid 
telescoping and for this, if necessary, the court should commence sitting earlier and 
continue sitting later than the normal hours.  
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid instructions 
of the Hon‟ble Court to all the judicial officers working under your supervision and 
control for strict compliance for ensuring he expeditious disposal of Sessions 
cases.  
  
 
11. 
JURISDICTION 
 
(i) 
Compliance of the directions given by Hon‘ble Court in Criminal 
Appeal No. 5005/2009, Smt. Manbhawati Pathak vs. State of U.P. read 
with Criminal Appeal No. 5298/2009, Shashi Ranjan Pandey vs. State of 
U.P. 
 
C.L. No. 27/Admin. G-II dated: Allahabad 04.09.2013. 
 
 
The Hon‟ble Court while considering the above mentioned Criminal 
Appeals has noticed that the trial courts mostly manned by Additional Sessions 
75 
 
Judges are being described by them as Special Court (E.C. Act), N.D.P.S. Act etc. 
while pronouncing the judgments in sessions trials which is not in accordance with 
the provisions given in section 9 of Cr.P.C., as the court of sessions has to be 
manned by a Sessions Judge, jurisdiction of which may also be exercised by an 
Additional Sessions Judge. The said scheme of allocating the jurisdiction in 
Cr.P.C. does not recognize any Special Judge or any Special Sessions Judge in 
respect of session trials, therefore use of such designation creates great confusion 
as no such nomenclatures are assigned to a court of sessions which carries out 
sessions trials as per Chapter XVIII of the Cr.P.C. No Special Judge under any Act 
is empowered to try an offence which is shown triable by the court of sessions as 
per the schedule of the Cr.P.C., however it is true that the special court so 
constituted under an Special Act may have to be manned by either a Sessions 
Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge. Therefore the Hon‟ble Court has directed 
that the officers be instructed not to describe their courts by names which creates 
confusion or which does not really reflect their constitution as per Cr.P.C. while 
delivering judgments in sessions cases. 
 
Upon consideration of the above judgment and order of the Hon‟ble Court, it 
has been resolved to circulate the copy of the said judgment among all the offices 
working under your administrative control for their necessary guidance and 
compliance.  
 
Therefore, enclosing herewith a copy of the said judgment and order, I am to 
request you to kindly circulate a copy of the same among all the offices of your 
judgeship for strict compliance of the same. 
 
 
 
(ii) 
Expeditious disposal of the trial of SC/ST Cases 
 
C.L. No. 12/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 28.04.2014 
 
In continuation of Court‟s earlier circular letter no. 07 dated 20.02.2007, I 
am directed to request to impress upon all the Judicial Officers working under your 
administrative control to conclude all criminal trials including the trial of SC/ST 
Cases as early as possible with the help of Amended provision of Section 309 of 
Code of Criminal Procedure.  
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid direction of 
Hon‟ble Court to all the Judicial Officers working under your supervision and 
control for their information and necessary compliance.  
 
(iii) 
To ensure speedy trial of cases relating to atrocities on Scheduled Castes 
and Scheduled Tribes.  
76 
 
 
C.L. No. 7/2007/Admin. ‗G‘ Dated: Allahabad 20.02.2007 
 
The Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi has 
nominated to the Court that the Parliamentary Committee on the Welfare of 
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes on the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, while 
considering the matter pertaining to atrocities on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled 
Tribes and patters of social crimes towards them recommended as under:  
“The Committee are aware that one of the terms of reference of the 
Malimath Committee was to suggest a round system of managing, on 
professional lines, the pendency of cases at investigation and trial stages and 
making the Police, the Prosecution and the Judicial accountable for delays in 
their respective domains. The Committee feel that the time taken in disposal 
of atrocity cases should be considerably cut short. The Ministry of Law and 
Justice should look into this matter and take necessary steps. The Committee 
hope that the Sessions Courts notified on special courts would given up top 
priority to atrocity cases which in the opinion of the Committee will help in 
bringing the pendency down.” 
 
Therefore, in this regard while enclosing herewith a copy of D.O. No. 
11017/60/2001-JUS(M), dated December 22, 2006 of Sri Rajiv Agarwal, 
Additional Secretary, Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi, 
I am directed to request you to impress upon the concerned Courts to ensure 
speedy trial of cases pertaining to atrocities committed against Scheduled Casters 
and Sche4duled Tribes, so as to minimize the pendency of such cases.  
 
D.O. No. 11017/60/2001-JUS (M), dated December 22, 2006. 
 
The Parliamentary Committee on the Welfare of Scheduled Castes and 
Scheduled Tribes on the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Social Justice and 
Empowerment and Ministry of Tribal Affairs, while considering the matter 
pertaining to atrocities on SCs and STs and pattern of social crimes towards them 
recommended as under:   
 
“The Committee are aware that one of the terms of reference of the 
Malimath Committee was to suggest a sound system of managing, on professional 
lines, the pendency of cases at investigation and trial stages and making the Police, 
the prosecution and the judiciary accountable for delays in their respective 
domains. The Committee feels that the time taken in disposal of atrocity cases 
should be considerably cut short. The Ministry of Law and Justice should look into 
this matter and take necessary steps. The Committee hope that the Sessions Courts 
notified as Special Courts would give up top priority to atrocity cases which in the 
opinion of the Committee will help in bringing the pendency down.” 
2. 
The Government give an Action Taken Reply as under:- 
77 
 
 
“The recommendation of the Committee has been noted. The Government 
would endeavour to impress upon the Courts and the law enforcing agencies to 
ensure speedy trial of atrocity cases s as to bring down the pendency.” 
 
I shall, therefore, be grateful if the matter is placed before the Chief Justice 
of your High Court for such action as he deems fit.

Tel No. 23384661 
23385046 
December 20, 2010 
Dear Sri Gupta, 
 
Whenever a convict is sentenced to a term of imprisonment and he prefers a 
petition before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, it is required to be stated in petition 
whether he has surrendered as per Order XXI Rule 6 of Supreme Court Rules, 
1966. Proof of surrender by such petitioner is one of the pre-condition for posting 
such petition for hearing unless the Hon‟ble Court, on a written application for the 
purpose, orders to the contrary. 
 
Ascertaining the veracity of proof of surrender, at times, takes a long time. 
Now, therefore, it is requested that when a convict surrenders to undergo the term 
of imprisonment and informs the Court or to the jail authorities that he has filed a 
petition before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, the Court as well as the jail authorities 
concerned be directed to ensure that one the same day of surrendering, surrender 
certificate is forward to the Registrar (Judicial-I), Supreme Court of India, and a 
copy is immediately faxed to him. Suitable directions may kindly be issued to all 
Courts of Sessions/Magistrates and Jailors. 
Yours faithfully, 
(A.I.S. Cheema)

Clubbing all the Motor Accident Claim Petitions arising from the same 
accident. 
 
C.L. No. 07/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 06.02.2015 
 
 
Hon‟ble Court has noticed that on several occasions claim petitions under 
Motor Vehicles Act arising out of same accident are tried and decided by different 
courts separately resulting in conflicting findings/decisions.  
 
In order to avoid such conflicting findings and decisions, it is directed by 
Hon‟ble Court that all claim petitions arising from the same accident should be 
clubbed and tried together by the same court, as for as possible, may be by separate 
judgments.  
81 
 
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid directions to 
all the Judicial Offices including Judges presiding over the Motor Accident Claims 
Tribunal, working under your supervision and control for their information and 
necessary compliance.

83 
 
I have been directed to say that upon consideration of the above mentioned 
subject the Hon‟ble Court is of the view that on receipt of intimation from the High 
Court about the pendency of Government Appeal, Criminal Appeal or Revision, 
the Original record related thereto shall be segregated and safety kept apart for

(ii) 
Preservation of Subordinate Court Record 
C.L. No. 22/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 06.06.2015 
It has been frequently experienced by the Hon‟ble Court that lower court 
records are lost, misplaced or destroyed for any reason. Due to this disposal of 
criminal appeals in the Hon‟ble Court is hindered and sometimes the 
reconstruction of the record is also impossible.  
I am therefore directed to request you to ensure that, before transmitting the 
lower court records (as detailed in Rule 25 to 29 of Chapter XVIII of the Rules of 
the Court) to this Court, the same shall be duly scanned and authentically 
preserved in server (as soft copy) so that in case of loss/destruction/misplacement 
of the same, the soft copy may be available for purpose of reconstruction. 
 
You are, therefore, requested to ensure the strict compliance of the 
above mentioned directions with immediate effect.  
Encl.: As above.

dated 31.07.2013 in Govrnment Appeal No. 1866/1985 State of U.P. vs. 
Inamullah and others; order dated 31.07.2013 in Government Appeal 
No. 2111/1986, State of U.P. vs. Satyavati and others. 
 
C.L.No. 30/Admin. Dated: Allahabad 15.9.2013. 
 
 
While considering the above mentioned appeals, the Hon‟ble Court was 
distressed to note that the judicial record in all these appeals had been made over to 
the District Magistrate by the District Court on their being requisitioned and were 
never returned resulting in hampering of the disposal of these appeals for want of 
judicial record, while according to the provisions of Cr.P.C., the judicial record 
could be summoned only by a court of revision or appeal. If there was any need of 
any record for facilitating filing of an appeal, the State of U.P. should have 
obtained the copies of the records after observing due formalities of the Rules in 
that behalf.  
 
Upon consideration of the matter, the Hon‟ble Court has resolved that no 
judicial record would be transmitted to any executive authority rather only the 
inspection of the required record may be permitted within the court premises and 
copies of the records, if required, may be obtained as per rules.  
 
Therefore enclosing copies of the above mentioned judgment, I am directed 
to request you to kindly impress upon all the judicial officers working under your 
administrative control to make strict compliance of the directions contained herein. 
Kindly treat this as most urgent.

Hon‟ble Court has directed to ensure that no outsider be allowed to handle any 
judicial record of the Court. I any employee is found to have permitted any 
outsider to handle any judicial record, or to have engage any outsider to assist him 
87 
 
in court work you have to take stern action against the defaulting employee under 
the intimation to the court. 
 
The Hon‟ble Court has further directed you to obtain written undertaking

displeasure on continuous complaints of loss of records on account of their 
handling by outsiders, illegally engaged in District Courts, even after clear 
directions of Hon‟ble Court in this regard. 
In this connection, I am directed to reiterate the directions given in above-
mentioned circular letters and direction of Hon‟ble Court that no outsider shall be

LEGAL AID 
 
Compliance of the direction given by Hon‘ble Supreme Court in 
Criminal Appeal Nos. 1899-1900 of 2011 – Mohammed Ajmal 
89 
 
Mohammad Amir Kasab @ Abu Mujahid vs. State of Maharashtra 
(Para 484) regarding providing legal aid in case the accused has 
nomeans to engage a lawyer of his choice.  
 
C.L. No. 02/Admin. ‗G-II‘ Dated: Allahabad 15.01.2013 
 
 
I am directed to say that Hon„ble Supreme Court in its judgment dated 
29.08.2012 passed in Criminal Appeal Nos. 1899-1900 of 2011 – Mohammed 
Ajmal Mohammad Amir Kasab @ Abu Mujahid v. State of Maharashtra has 
observed that the right to access to legal aid, to consult and to be defended by a 
legal practitioner, arises when a person, arrested in connection with a cognizable 
offence, is first produced before a magistrate. Hon‟ble Supreme Court accordingly, 
holds that it is the duty and obligation of the magistrate before whom a person 
accused of committing a cognizable offence is first produced to make him fully 
aware that it is his right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner and, in 
case he has no means to engage a lawyer of his choice, that one would be provided 
to him from legal aid at the expense of the State. This is the right that flows from 
Articles 21 and 22(1) of the Constitution of India and needs to be strictly enforced.  
 
Hon‟ble Apex Court has, accordingly, directed all the magistrates in the 
country to faithfully discharge aforesaid duty and obligation. It has further been 
made clear by Hon‟ble Apex Court that any failure to fully discharge the duty 
would amount to dereliction in duty and would make the concerned magistrate 
liable to departmental proceedings.  
 
I am, therefore, to request you to kindly download a copy of the above 
mentioned judgment 29.08.2012 and bring the directions, contained therein to the 
notice of all concerned working under your supervision and control to strictly 
comply with the directions contained in said judgment.

Upon consideration of the D.O. letter dated 26.12.2012 of Dr. Ashwani 
Kumar, Hon‟ble Minister for Law and Justice, Government of India, on the above 
noted subject, I have been directed to inform you that the Hon‟ble Court has been

the sufficient cause, such calls should not be entertained by the District Judge and 
the President, Secretary or other office bearers of the Bar Associations should be 
convinced by the District Judge not to proceed on strike. The District Judge will 
create an environment of work in the Judgeship after proper counseling and 
convincing the lawyers in this regard. 
I have been further directed to say that in case of the strike by lawyers for 
local problem, the District Judge may be asked to immediately solve the problem 
with the cooperation and coordination of the office bearers of the Bar Associations. 
The District Judge may also form a redressal committee in the District consisting 
of senior most Judicial Officer as Chairman, some other senior Judicial Officer, 
C.J.M. and Civil Judge (Senior Division) as its members. The President and 
Secretary of the Bar Association should also be kept as ex-officio members of the 
said committee. The said committee should be sensitive towards the problems of 
the members of Bar and the staff of the Judgeship and should solve the problem in 
justifiable manner so that nobody can have any grievance against the judgeship. 
You are, therefore, requested to kindly bring the contents of this circular 
letter to the notice of all concerned and ensure strict compliance with the 
intimation to the Court.
