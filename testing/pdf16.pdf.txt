1.4 
In this backdrop, transactions of Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish 
Biyani were examined. It was observed that these entities transacted 
heavily in the scrip of DSQ Industries Ltd. From the details of trade log 
and order log of the exchange from November 1, 2000 till March 31, 2001, 
it was observed that shares were not frequently traded. There were no 
major volumes observed till December 2000 and from December 6 to 
December 18 and December 20 & 21, significant volumes were observed. 
Further, analysis of price movement revealed that the price of the shares 
increased sharply from levels of Rs. 350- on January 1, 2001 to levels of 
Rs. 450/- on January 8, 2001. Significant trading was also observed on 4 
days in the period i.e. January 1, 2, 4 and 8, 2001. Further, there was a 
spurt in the price in November 2000 also and the price started moving up 
from December 19, 2000 onwards. It was further observed that this price 
increase was on very low volumes of 100-500 shares. The trade analysis  
found  are as under: 
 
a) During November 2000 Titan Stock Broking Limited, Shri Harish 
Biyani, Amritlal Gopalji Thacker, Niraj Balasaria artificially increased 
the price of DSQ Industries through their trades. Titan Stock 
Broking and Amritlal Thackerji stated that transactions were done 
for various DSQ Industries Ltd. Promoter group entities like 
Cooltex, Hulda etc. 
 
b) On December 20, 2000, the price of the scrip increased from 
Rs.298 to Rs.320 when Biyani Securities (P) Ltd traded in the scrip 
and in the next trade when SMIFS Securities traded, the price 
increased to Rs. 339 when a cross deal  between Hulda Properties 
and SMIFS capital Markets was entered.

1.5 
From the order log and trade log for the period 1/1/01 to 8/1/01, it was 
revealed that a large number of trades were carried on only between 2 
brokers – namely Shri Harish Biyani and Amritlal Gopalji Thacker. Further, 
it was observed that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. an associate of Shri Harish 
Biyani entered into cross deals also. On analysis, it was revealed that 
orders were placed at almost the same time by the buying and selling 
brokers. There was creation of artificial market and artificial volumes by 
synchronization of logging in of orders. Both the buying as well as selling 
orders were put by the buying and selling brokers for same quantity and 
for same price at the same time. The orders were also placed at prices 
higher than the last traded price. The price was thus artificially increased.

From the above, it is observed that there was creation of artificial market 
and artificial volumes as a result of synchronization in logging in / 
matching of buy and sell orders amongst few brokers. Orders were 
purchased within a gap of few seconds by Shri Harish Biyani for the same 
quantity and same rate to ensure that buyers get the desired sellers and 
vice versa. Thus, there was circular trading also. There was price 
manipulation as the orders were placed at successively  higher prices than 
the last traded prices. 
 
4.3 
It is noted that after the share prices rose dramatically from Rs.342 to 
Rs.450 against low volumes of trades as seen from the above trades, 
there were several cross deals by Shir Harish Biyani wherein both the 
buyer and seller were his clients for very large volumes to the tune of 
10000 shares per transaction as shown under :

Further, there was synchronization of logging in of orders. These 
transactions were also in the nature of synchronization of trades / matched 
orders/ structured trading which ensured matching of orders of seller with 
a specific buyer. These orders were placed simultaneously or within close 
proximity of each other. From the client code entered by the broker, it 
Page 14 of 41 
appears that the clients are Greenfield and Naina Barter. These 
transactions were to the tune of 2,20,000 shares and comprised 99% of 
the traded volumes on that day.  
 
4.4 
Similar transactions of high volumes were also observed on other dates 
i.e. 13/11/00, 15/11/00, 6/12/00, 12/12/00, 13/12/00, 14/12/00, 18/12/00, 
20/12/00 and 21/12/00. Investigation into the order log and trade log on 
these dates brought out that transactions on these dates were  also cross 
deals of Shri Harish Biyani. These transactions were also in the nature of 
synchronization of logging in of buy and sell orders with buy and sell order 
were put within close proximity of each other.    
 
4.5 
Therefore, I find that the price was artificially pushed  from Rs. 340 levels 
to Rs. 452 levels within 4 trading days i.e. an increase of 33% on low 
volumes. Trading was concentrated among 3 brokers namely Shri Harish 
Biyani, Niraj Kumar Balasaria and Amritlal Gopalji Thacker. There was 
creation of artificial market and artificial volumes as a result of 
synchronization of  logging in / matching of buy and sell orders.  Orders 
were put within a gap of very few seconds by Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. 
and Shri Harish Biyani for the same quantity and same rate to ensure that 
buyers get the desired sellers and vice versa.  
 
4.6 
The transactions done by Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish 
Biyani, in the ‘sell n cash’ scheme of SHCIL on 27/2/01 and 1/3/01 and 
cash on payout scheme on 2/3/01 in the shares of DSQ Industries is 
strong pointer to the promoter broker nexus between DSQ Group & Biyani 
Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani. Promoters colluded with Biyani 
Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani in obtaining finance on account 
of Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani facing payment crisis 
on the CSE. Funds to the tune of approximately Rs. 34 crore and Rs. 8 
crore were availed on 27/2/01 and 1/3/01 in the ‘sell n cash’ scheme. 
Page 15 of 41 
These funds were made available on the same date as the transaction 
date. Thereafter, funds to the extent of around Rs. 24 crore was availed 
for cash on payout transactions done on 2/3/01. This amount was made 
available on 5/3/01 by discounting a post dated cheque given by SHCIL.  
 
4.7 
As stated above, the Promoters colluded with Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. 
and Shri Harish Biyani. Promoter associated entities – Hulda, Square D 
Textiles) credited shares of DSQ Industries to the demat account of Biyani 
Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani then used these shares in 
addition to other shares lying with Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri 
Harish Biyani to avail of the schemes of SHCIL to obtain immediate sale 
consideration in the ‘sell-n-cash’ scheme of SHCIL as discussed above. 
Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani also discounted post 
dated cheques given to them by SHCIL under the ‘cash on payout’ 
scheme. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. was empanelled broker for selling the 
shares. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. availed finance for self as well as for 
Shri Harish Biyani for selling these shares in the schemes. 
 
4.8 
The buying broker was Shri Harish Biyani who was buying shares for DSQ 
group entities. Shares were brought in synchronised deals with buying and 
selling orders logged in at almost the same time for same rate and 
quantity with prior understanding to match sell orders with specific buy 
orders. Brokers indulged in creation of artificial market, creation of artificial 
volumes as a result of synchronization / prior intention to matching orders. 
There was creation of artificial market and artificial volumes as a result of 
synchronization in logging in / matching of buy and sell orders.  Orders are 
put within a gap of very few seconds by Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and 
Shri Harish Biyani for the same quantity and same rate with a prior 
intention to match the orders to ensure that buyers get the desired sellers 
and vice versa. Shares effectively did not change beneficial ownership by 
remaining within the DSQ group. Thus, there was circular trading also.

From the above, it is noted that the buy as well as the sell orders were 
placed in lots of 10,000 shares for the entire quantity (except for lot of 
5000 shares on few occasions). It is noted that the buy and sell orders 
were placed in close proximity of time 5-15 seconds. In view of the fact 
that it was an ill-liquid segment and the buy and the sell orders were 
placed consecutively with a very short time difference which is often under 
few seconds, it can be said that these trades were synchronized by the 
brokers with prior understanding to match. There was creation of artificial 
market and artificial volumes as a result of synchronization in logging in / 
matching of buy and sell orders. 
 
4.11 As observed earlier, Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. sold as empanelled broker 
a total of 10.4 lakh shares of DSQ . Of these, 8.7 lakh shares were sold for 
Self and 1.7 lakh for Shri Harish Biyani. In connection with the sale of 8.7 
lakh shares, examination of the demat statement Biyani Securities Pvt. 
Ltd. brought out that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani got 
shares in their demat account in the following manner:

was from the demat account of Square D Textiles – a DSQ group entity.  
 
Page 23 of 41 
4.12 Statement on behalf of Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. admitted that Square D 
textiles was never its client and the shares were received from ‘Hulda’ who 
used to give specific instruction for subsequent sale of the shares. It does 
not explain why shares came into beneficiary account instead of the pool 
account. Regarding credits into its account from SMIFS,  Biyani Securities 
(P) Ltd stated that it purchased 1,55,000 shares in sett no. 146 from 
market through SMIFS Securities. As regards credit on 27/2/01 of 415000 
shares, Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. stated that it purchased 90,000 shares 
from the market and the balance 3,25,000 shares were transferred to it 
from ‘Hulda’. These 8,70,000 shares were then credited to the account of 
SHCIL. This shows the nexus between Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri 
Harish Biyani and the promoters. To facilitate financing Biyani Securities 
Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani by the ‘sell n cash’ scheme, 3,00,000 
shares were given to them by the promoter group entities Square D 
Textiles and 3,25,000 shares by ‘Hulda’. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and 
Shri Harish Biyani also had 2,55,000 shares already available. As regards 
sale of these 8.7 lakh shares in the ‘sell n cash’ scheme, Biyani Securities 
Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani stated that they sold the entire lot of 
8,70,000 shares on behalf of another DSQ group entity – ‘Hulda’. If shares 
were sold on behalf of Hulda as claimed,, shares should come from the 
beneficiary account of Hulda and not from Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and 
Shri Harish Biyani ‘s account. 
 
4.13 As regards sale of 1.7 lakh shares by Shri Harish Biyani, it was found 
during the course of investigations that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri 
Harish Biyani got shares in their demat account in the following manner:

Once again, it is seen that shares were credited as market purchases. 
Shri Harish Biyani stated that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish 
Biyani had purchased these shares from the market through SMIFS. The 
contentions by Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani that they 
sold 1.7 lakh shares on behalf of DSQ group entity – Hulda is not tenable 
since if shares were to be sold on behalf of Hulda, shares would have 
been sold from the beneficiary account of Hulda and not from broker’s 
account.  
 
On the other side, as buying broker, Shri Harish Biyani stated that Biyani 
Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani had purchased 1,70,000 shares 
as part of total 10,40,000 shares purchased by them for various clients as 
below:

4.14 It may be noted that many of the buying clients as above have same 
address as that of ‘Hulda’ and also Mr Bhalotia as common director in 
Hulda and the buying clients. Hulda as brought out earlier is promoter 
associated entity. Thus, for the entire transactions of 10,40,000 shares, 
Page 25 of 41 
both the buying as well as the selling clients have linkages with each other 
and DSQ group.  
 
These transactions were in the nature of synchronization with buying 
orders and selling orders matched for quantity and price. Orders were put 
within time gap of few seconds. Both buying and selling brokers were 
Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani who indulged in creation 
of artificial market, creation of artificial volumes as a result of 
synchronization / prior intention to matching orders. In view of the fact that 
both brokers belong to Biyani group and the synchronization has 
happened over so many transactions, the stand taken by either broker is 
not tenable. Further, the transactions accounted for the entire trading 
volume i.e. 100% on that date.  
 
4.15 On March 1, 2001, Shri Harish Biyani once again availed of the ‘Sell and 
Cash’ Scheme through Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. which sold 2,40,000 
shares of DSQ Industries @ Rs 335 per share for Shri Harish Biyani. It is 
observed that when selling broker was Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd., the 
buying broker for the shares on the other side was Shri Harish Biyani.   
The order log and trade log revealed that there was synchronization of 
buying and selling orders as under:

From the above, it can be seen that all orders both buy as well as sell 
were placed in multiples of 10,000 and apart from these orders there were 
no other buy as well as sale orders prevalent at that time and time lag 
between buy and sale order in most of the occasions was very less and  it 
Page 27 of 41 
can be concluded that these were synchronized transactions with prior 
understanding to match.  
 
4.16 Examination of the demat statement of Shri Harish Biyani brought out that 
on 1/3/01, 2,40,000 shares were debited from beneficiary account of Shri 
Harish Biyani in favour of SHCIL for the sale of 2,40,000 shares. It is 
pertinent to note that Shri Harish Biyani got shares in its demat account in 
the following manner: 
 
Date 
Particulars  
Qty 
21/2/01 
 By Integrated / 10290048 
350000 
 
 
These shares were credited as off market purchases and were credited 
from the demat account of Hulda. Shri Harish Biyani stated that Biyani 
Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani sold 2,40,000 shares on behalf 
of Hulda. If shares were to be sold on behalf of Hulda, shares would have 
been sold from the beneficiary account of Hulda and not from Biyani 
Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani’s account. In effect, Shri Harish 
Biyani used shares of DSQ Industries for availing finance in the ‘sell and 
cash’ scheme of SHCIL by selling shares as empanelled broker of SHCIL 
– i.e. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd.  
 
4.17 Further, when Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. was selling shares, Shri Harish 
Biyani was the counter party broker. Shri Harish Biyani stated that Biyani 
Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani had bought these 2,40,000 
shares on behalf of client – Veersali Commodities Ltd. I further note that 
address of Veersali is same as that of Hulda and also one of the directors 
and contact person of this entity is Mr. Manoj Kumar Bhalotia who is also 
a director of M/s. Hulda Properties and Trades Limited – the seller. 
Therefore Veersali Commodities Limited also appears to be an entity of 
Page 28 of 41 
DSQ group. These further points to nexus between promoters and Biyani 
Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani when it is noticed that shares 
bought by broker for promoter associated entity – Veersali were sold on 
the other side for another promoter associated entities – Hulda. Thus, 
there was circular trading also as well as creation of artificial market. 
Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani indulged in creation of 
artificial market, creation of artificial volumes as a result of synchronization 
of orders. CSE had subsequently expunged the transaction of 2,40,000 
shares amounting to Rs. 8.04 crore  on the grounds that the transactions 
were  non genuine transactions. It is pertinent to note this deal of 2,40,000 
shares comprised around 60% of the total traded volume on the said date. 
 
4.18 On March 2, 2001, Shri Harish Biyani once again availed the Cash on Pay 
out scheme (COP) of SHCIL through Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. which sold 
7,20,000 shares of DSQ Industries for Shri Harish Biyani. The important 
feature of this scheme are as under:  
 
a) As per the scheme an investor can sell his shares through one of 
the empanelled brokers of SHCIL and the payment is released to 
the investor on the next day of the pay out.  For this purpose a                
post-dated cheque (dated to next day of pay out) is issued to the 
investor by SHCIL on the evening of trade day.  
 
b) The features of this scheme are same as SAC and the only 
difference being that the payment is released one day after pay out.  
As per SCHIL, this was only a variant of the SAC scheme wherein 
a post dated payment cheque was issued instead of a current date 
cheque. 
 
c) The objective of COP scheme was to help the small investors who 
are not entertained by the brokers to transact (sell their shares) in 
Page 29 of 41 
the capital market in the risk free environment. Under this scheme 
the payment is released one day after the pay out of the relevant 
stock exchange.  
 
4.19 Shri Harish Biyani has a DP beneficiary account with SHCIL.  On 
1.3.2001, he requested SHCIL to sell 2.4 lakh shares of DSQ Industries 
Ltd under ‘sell-n-cash’ scheme.  The shares were sold on the same day by 
SHCIL in rolling settlement  No.2001518 of CSE through Biyani  Securities 
Pvt. Ltd., an associate firm of Shri Harish Biyani on whose behalf the trade 
was executed.  SHCIL made payment against this transaction to Shri 
Biyani on the same day after deducting brokerage and service charges 
from the sale proceeds of Rs.8.04 crore.  SHCIL also executed another 
transaction for sale of 7.2 lakh shares of DSQ Industries under ‘sell-n-
cash’ scheme on behalf of Shri Biyani through Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd in 
settlement no.2001159 for Rs.24.48 crore on 2.3.2001.  Unlike the earlier 
transaction, SHCIL released the payment through a post dated cheque to 
Shri Biyani who discounted the cheque with Indus Ind Bank, Calcutta and 
received the sale proceeds. 
 
4.20 In the transactions of sale of DSQ Industries shares dated 1.3.01 financed 
by SHCIL on behalf of its clients Shri Harish Biyani under ‘sell-n-cash’ 
scheme through Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd and CSE, the counter party 
broker was Shri Harish Biyani himself.  In the transaction dated 2.3.2001, 
assured / facilitated by SHCIL for Shri Harish Biyani the counter party 
brokers were Shri Harish Biyani, Arihant Exim & Doe Jones, CSE, on 
scrutiny of pay-in/pay-out of settlement no.148 and the rolling settlements 
falling due during the same time, classified the trades financed / assured 
by SHCIL through Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd  as trades in the nature of 
accommodation and expunged these trades. 
 
Page 30 of 41 
4.21 Shri Harish Biyani stated that since he was in need of funds he sold DSQ 
shares to SHCIL and received a post dated cheque from them and got the 
cheque discounted.  He further said that SHCIL in turn sold those shares 
in the market on the same day through Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd  but CSE 
did not make payment since the deals were expunged. 
 
4.22 As stated, earlier, on 2/3/01, Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. sold 7,20,000 
shares in the ‘cash on payout’ scheme of SHCIL. The table showing the 
various trading parties for the transaction is as follows:

It was also seen that when Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. sold 7,20,000 
shares, on the buying side, it was Shri Harish Biyani who purchased 
Page 34 of 41 
2,20,000 shares. The balance 5,00,000 shares were purchased by 2 
brokers belonging to the D K Singhania group. It was later brought out that 
the CSE had expunged the entire transactions of 7,20,000 shares on the 
ground that they were non genuine transactions. 
 
4.23 Shri Harish Biyani stated that it bought these shares for client - Kettlewell 
Tracom. It is pertinent to note that address of Kettelwell is same as that of 
‘Hulda’ and also one of the directors and contact person of this entity is 
Mr. Manoj Kumar Bhalotia who is also a director of M/s. Hulda Properties 
and Trades Limited. Therefore, Kettelwell Commodities Limited also is  an 
entity of DSQ group. The transactions done by Biyani group of brokers in 
the ‘sell n cash’ scheme of SCHIL on 27/2/01 and 1/3/01 and ‘cash on 
payout’ scheme on 2/3/01 in the shares of DSQ Industries is strong 
pointer to the promoter broker nexus between DSQ Group and Biyani 
group of brokers. Promoters colluded with Biyani group in obtaining 
finance on account of Biyani brokers facing payment crises on the CSE. 
As discussed in detail later, funds to the tune of approximately Rs. 34 
crore and Rs. 8 crore were availed on 27/2/01 and 1/3/01 in the ‘sell n 
cash’ scheme of SHCIL. Thus, funds were made available on the same 
date as the transaction date. Thereafter, funds to the extent of around Rs. 
24 crore was availed for cash on payout transactions done on 2/3/01. This 
amount was made available on 5/3/01 by discounting a post dated cheque 
given by SHCIL. 
 
4.24 In view of the foregoing, it can be concluded that Biyani Securities Pvt. 
Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani had acted in concert with the promoters and its 
associate entities – Hulda, Square D Textiles which credited shares of 
DSQ Industries to the demat account of Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and 
Shri Harish Biyani. Shares of promoter entities were  also credited through 
SMIFS Securities Ltd. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani 
then used these shares in addition to other shares lying with it to avail of 
Page 35 of 41 
the schemes of SHCIL to obtain immediate sale consideration in the sell n 
cash scheme of SHCIL as discussed above. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. 
was empanelled broker of SHCIL for selling the shares in the said 
schemes. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. availed finance for self as well as for 
Shri Harish Biyani for selling these   shares in the schemes. The buying 
broker was Shri Harish Biyani who was buying shares for DSQ group 
entities. Shares were brought in synchronised deals with buying and 
selling orders logged in at almost the same time for same rate and 
quantity with prior understanding to match sell orders with specific buy 
orders. Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani indulged in 
creation of artificial market, creation of artificial volumes as a result of 
synchronization / prior intention to matching orders. There was creation of 
artificial market and artificial volumes as a result of synchronization in 
logging in / matching of buy and sell orders.  Orders are placed within a 
gap of few seconds by Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani 
for the same quantity and same rate to ensure that buyers get the desired 
sellers and vice versa. Shares effectively did not change beneficial 
ownership by remaining within the DSQ group. Thus, there was circular 
trading also. The transactions also created artificial market. 
 
4.25 I also note that when Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. sold 7,20,000 shares, on 
the buying side, Harish Biyani purchased 2,20,000 shares. The balance 
5,00,000 shares were purchased by the Arihant Exim Scrip Pvt. Ltd. and 
Doe Jones Investments & Consultants Pvt. Ltd. who were brokers at the 
relevant time and belonged to the D K Singhania group (2,50,000 shares 
each). 
 
4.26 In appeal no 54 of 2002 – Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt. Ltd vs. SEBI, the 
Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal has held as under with regard to 
synchronized deals 
 
Page 36 of 41 
“BEB has been charged for synchronized deals with First Global. I have 
examined the data provided by the parties on this issue. I find many 
transactions between BEB and FGSB. There are many instances of such 
transactions. I find the scrip, quantity and price for these orders had been 
synchronized by the counter party brokers. Such transactions undoubtedly 
create an artificial market to mislead the genuine investors. Synchronized 
trading is violative of all prudential and transparent norms of trading in 
securities. Synchronized trading on a large scale can create false 
volumes. The argument that the parties had no means of knowing whether 
any entity controlled by the client is simultaneously entering any contra 
order elsewhere for the reason that in the online trading system, 
confidentiality of counter parties is ensured, is untenable. It was submitted 
by the Appellants that it was not possible for the broker to know who the 
counter party broker is and that trades were not synchronized but it was 
only a coincidence in some cases. Theoretically this is OK. But when 
parties decide to synchronize the transaction the story is different. There 
are many transactions giving an impression that these were all 
synchronized, otherwise there was no possibility of such perfect matching 
of quantity price etc. As the Respondent rightly stated it is too much of a 
coincidence over too long a period in too many transactions when both 
parties to the transaction had entered buy and sell orders for the same 
quantity of shares almost simultaneously.” 
 
Such transactions wherein the buy and sell orders were entered almost 
simultaneously  and the time lag is just under few seconds as aforesaid 
and the transactions are matched in terms of order quantity, price and 
time are highly irregular and defeat the purpose of normal order matching 
system in the price discovery process in the exchanges and would also be 
in violation of Regulation of 4 of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair 
Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) 1995 which reads as under:-  
 
Page 37 of 41 
Prohibition against market manipulation. 
4 No persons shall 
(a) effect, take part in, or enter into, either directly or indirectly, 
transactions in securities, with the intention of artificially raising or 
depressing the prices of securities and thereby inducing the sale or 
purchase of securities by any person; 
(b) indulge in any act, which is calculated to create a false or misleading 
appearance of trading on the securities markets; 
(c) indulge in any act, which results in reflection of prices of securities 
based on transactions that are not genuine trade transactions; 
(d) enter into a purchase or sale of any securities, not intended to effect 
transfer of beneficial ownership but intended to operate only as a 
device to inflate, depress, or cause fluctuation in the market price of 
securities; 
 
4.27 As already noted above, when Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. sold 7.2 lac 
shares of DSQ Industries, Shri Harish Biyani purchased 2.2 lac shares 
and the rest were purchased by Arihant Exim Scrip Pvt. Ltd. and Doe 
Jones Investments & Consultants Pvt. Ltd.  It is therefore, concluded that 
the brokers viz. Shri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd acted in 
concert with the promoters of DSQ Group for creation of artificial market 
and rise in prices by entering into irregular transactions by way of 
synchronized trades and cross deals in which the order, quantity, time and 
prices are matched, financing of trades through the schemes of SHCIL, 
etc. as discussed above 
 
Acting in concert is something about which actual evidence is normally 
difficult to come. The Supreme Court had dealt with the issue in the case 
of CIT vs. East Coast Commercial Co. Ltd. AIR (1967) SC 768 (Kedia 
Family case) in the context of Section 23A of the Indian Income Tax Act, 
1922 wherein the question was whether Kedia family had acted in concert 
Page 38 of 41 
to control the affairs of the concerned company. In the facts of that case, 
there was no evidence of any overt act showing that they were acting in 
concert and thereby constituted and acted as a block.  
 
 In para 14 of the judgement, the SC observed as follows: 
 
“…..  It is sufficient, if having regard to their relation, etc., their conduct and 
their common interest, that it may be inferred that they must be acting 
together, evidence of actual concerted acting is normally difficult to obtain, 
and is not insisted upon.” (p.772) 
 
Hence, it is clear from the above that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri 
Harish Biyani had together indulged in creation of artificial market, artificial 
price rise, giving misleading appearance of trades and hence have 
violated Regulation 4 of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade 
Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 1995 as aforesaid. 
 
4.28 The method and manner of execution of these transactions whereby the 
order price, quantity and time are matched was highly irregular and 
against the normal price discovery mechanism in Stock Exchanges.  It 
was contended that Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd and Harish Biyani are 
separate and distinct entities.  While the former is a company registered 
under the Companies Act, 1956, the latter is an individual broking firm.  As 
such, it was contended that both of them cannot be clubbed together for 
the aforesaid  show cause notice for  irregular transactions. 
 
4.29 The JPC Report dated 19.12.2002 on stock market scam  at para 6.21 
observed that a number of large brokers have more than one card in CSE 
which are either in the name of their family members or companies where 
they are major shareholders.  Shri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt 
Ltd are amongst such brokers.

Pvt Ltd to the CSE where they were declared defaulters by the Exchange

Both Shri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd were declared 
defaulters on 26.3.2001 by the CSE.  One of the reasons for the payment 
problem at CSE was building up of large outstanding positions by few 
brokers in few scrips mainly in HFCL and DSQ and volatility in the prices 
during the relevant period.          
 
In this context, the Hon’ble Supreme Court decision in Delhi Development 
Authority vs Skipper Construction Co. Pvt Ltd. (1996) 4 Comp LJ 233 (SC) 
… AIR 1996 SC 2005 that (para 27 at page 247 of COMP LJ ) may be 
referred to. 
 
“The concept of corporate entity was evolved to encourage and promote 
trade and commerce but not to commit illegalities or to defraud people. 
Where , therefore, the corporate character is employed for the purpose of 
committing illegality or defrauding others , the court would ignore the 
corporate character and will look at the reality behind the corporate veil so 
as to enable it to pass appropriate orders to do justice between the parties 
concerned.  The fact that an individual and members of his family have 
created several corporate bodies would not prevent the court from treating 
Page 40 of 41 
all of them as one entity belonging to and controlled by that individual and 
family. If it is found that these corporate bodies are merely cloaks behind 
which lurks the individual and /or members of his family and that the 
device of incorporation was really a ploy adopted for committing illegalities 
and /or to defraud people”  (underlining supplied). 
 
                                                                                                                                                                              
Acting in concert is something about which actual evidence is normally 
difficult to come. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs East 
Coast Commercial Co.Ltd. AIR (1967) SC 768 (Kedia Family case) in the 
context of Section 23A of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 wherein the 
question was whether Kedia family had acted in concert to control the 
affairs of the concerned company.  In the facts of that case, there was no 
evidence of any overt act showing that they were acting in concert  and 
thereby constituted and acted as a block.  In para 14 of the judgment, the 
SC observed as follows: 
“….. if the members of the Kedia family form a block and had more than 
75 per cent of the voting power, it was not necessary to prove that they  
actually exercised controlling interest. It is the holding in aggregate of a 
majority of the shares issued by a person or persons acting in concert  in 
relation to the affairs of the company which establishes the existence of a 
block.  It is sufficient, if having regard to their relation, etc., their conduct 
and their common interest, that it may be inferred that they must be acting 
together, evidence of actual concerted acting is normally difficult to obtain, 
and is not insisted upon.” (p.772)(italics added).  
4.31 The evidence of connected circumstances and preponderance of 
probabilities, common course of natural events and combination of facts 
creating network and artificial volumes gives rise to a reasonable 
inference that Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani did not act 
Page 41 of 41 
in good faith and without negligence when they had executed these 
transactions.  
  
The standard of proof required in a proceeding of this nature is at variance 
with the standard of proof required in criminal cases. It is sufficient if the 
preponderance of probabilities suggests towards the indulgence of the 
delinquent in the misconduct.  The strict rules of Evidence Act and proof 
beyond reasonable doubt are not applicable to a proceeding of this nature. 
The Supreme Court’s decision in Gulabchand vs. Kudilal AIR, 1966, SC 
1734 and the decision of the Special Court for trial of offences relating to 
transactions in securities in the matter of National Housing Bank versus 
ANZ Grindlays Bank, 1998 (2 ) LJ 153 is relied upon in this regard.  
 
5.0 
ORDER 
 
Now, therefore, having regard to the nature and gravity of the charges 
established against Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shri Harish Biyani, I 
hereby, in exercise of powers under Section 11(4), 11B  of SEBI Act, 
1992,  and Regulation 11 of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair 
Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003, prohibit 
Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. and its directors and Shri Harish Biyani  from
