the learned English Judges in the first tea case would 
not be without relevance on the question of sentence 
in many cases of this kind. There can, I think, be no 
doubt that businessmen who are not lawyers 
might 
well be misled into thinking that the Ordinance and 
the Act did not intend to keep the Order of 1944 alive 
because the Order related to certain specified spices 
while the Ordinance and the Act changed the .nomen-
clature and limited themsleves to "foodstuffs", a term 
which, on a narrow view, would not include con-
diments and spices. 
However, these observations are 
not relevant here because we are not asked to restore 
either the conviction or the sentence. In view of that, 
there will be no further order and the acquittal 
will be left as it stands.

[1952] 
Held 
per 
Curiah 
(MAHAJAN, 
MuKHERJEA 
and 
CHANDRA· 
SEKHARA AtYAR JJ.)-Thc Bihar 
Land 
Reforms 
Act, 
XXX 
of 
1950, 
is not unconstitutional or void except with regard to the 
provisions in s. 4(b) and s. 23(f) thereof. 
The provisions of 
s. 
4(b) 
and 
s. 
23(f) 
are 
unconstitutional. 
Per 
PATANJALI 
SASTRI 
C. J. and DAs J~The whole 
of the 
Bihar 
Land 
Reforms 
Act 
of 
1950, 
including 
the provisions contained in 
s. 4(b) and s. 23(f) is constitutional and valid. 
Per 
PATANJALI 
SASTRI C. J., 
MAHAJAN, 
MuKHERJEA, 
D1i.s 
and CHANDRASEKHARA 
AIYAR JJ.-(i) The Bihar Land Reforms 
Act, XXX of 1950, is not a law in respect of a matter 
mention-
ed in entry 18 of List II, viz., "lands and land 
tenures", 
but a 
law in respect of "acquisition of property", a matter covered 
by entry 36 of List II. 
(ii) The obligation 
to 
pay 
compensation 
for 
property 
acquired 
by the State is not an obligation imposed by entry 36 
of List II read by itself or in conjunction with entry 42 of List III 
or by the spirit of the Constitution. 
Consequently, an 
objection 
to the validity of a statute in resixct of acquisition of property 
on the ground that it does not provide for payment of compen-
sation is an objection on the ground that it contravenes the 
provisions of. art. 31(2) and the jurisdiction of the Court to 
entertain such an objection in respect of a statute mentioned 
in 
the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution is barred by art. 31(4), 
art. 
31-A and art. 31-B 
of the Constitution. Per DAs /.-
Assuining 
that 
the 
obligation 
to 
pay 
compensation 
is 
also 
implicit in entry 36 of List II, in itself or read with entry 42 of 
List III, even then the validity of the Act cannot be questioned 
by reason of arts. 31( 4), 31-A and 31-B. 
(iii) Section 32(2) of the Act which empowers the State 
Government 
to 
frame 
rules 
providing 
for "the proportion 
in 
which compeinsation shall be payable in cash and in bonds and 
·the manner of payment pf such compensation" 
does 
not involve 
any delegation of legislative powers especially as 
the 
legislature 
has itself provided in s. 32(2) that the compensation shall be 
payable in cash or in bonds . or partly in cash and partly in 
bonds and fixed the number of instalments in which it should be 
paid. 
The words "subject to" in entry 36 of List II only mean 
that whenever a law is made by a State Legislature 
in 
exercise 
of its legislative power under entry 36, that law will be 
subject 
to the provisions of a law made by the Parliament under entry 42 
of List III. The words do not mean that when a State makes a 
law under entry 36 it must lay down the principles on which 
compensation payable for property acquired is to be determined 
and the form and manner in which it should be given. 
(iv) Entries in the Lc;gislative Lists arc merely of an enabl-
ing character. 
The power conferred thereunder on the legisla-
tures is not coupled with any duty on the legislature to exercise

:such power and the principle laid down in /ulius v. Bishop of 
Oxford [5 A.C. 214] has, therefore, no application to the Lists. 
Per 
PATANJALI 
SASTRI 
C. 
J., 
MuKHERJEA 
and 
DAs JJ. 
(MAHAJAN 
and 
CHANDRASEKHARA 
AIYAR 
JJ. 
dissenting).-The 
existence of a public purpose as a pre-requisite to the exercise of 
the power of compulsory acquisition is an essential and integral 
part of the provisions of art. 31(2) and an infringement of such 
a provision cannot be put forward as a ground for 
questioning 
the validity of an Act providing for compulsory acquisition. 
DAs. J.-Even assuming that the necessity of a public purpose is 
implied in entry 36 of List II and/or entry 42 of List III also, 
arts. 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B would still protect the Act from be-
ing questioned on the ground that the acquisition was not for a 
public purpose. In any case the impugned Act is supported by a 
public purpose. 
Per 
MAHAJAN and 
CHANDRASEKHARA 
A1YAR JJ.-The scope 
-0f art. 31(4) is limited to the express 
provisions of art. 31(2) 
and though the courts cannot examine the extent or 
adequacy 
-0f the provisions of compensation contained in any law dealing 
with the acquisition of property compulsorily, yet the 
provisions 
of art. 31 ( 4) do not in any way debar the court from consider• 
ing whether the acquisition is for a public purpose. 
Though 
the 
main object of the Act, viz., the acquisition of estates, is 
for 
a 
public purpose, the acquisition of arrears of rent due to the 
zamindars on payment of 50 per cent. of their value cannot be held 
to be for a public purpose and sec. 4 clause (b) of the Act is there-
fore unconstitutional 
and 
void. 
Per 
MuKHERJEA 
J.-Assuming 
that art. 31 ( 4) 
relates to everything that 
is 
provided for in 
art. 31 (2) either in express terms or even impliedly and conse-
quently thei question of the existence of a public purpose is not 
justiciable, as the real object of sec. 4, clause (b) is to deprive the 
man of his money, which is not a subject-matter for acquisition 
under the powers of eminent domain, without giving anything 
in exchanm under the guise of acting under entry 4 2 the legis-
lature has in truth and substance evaded and nullified its 
provi-
sions altogether and sec. 4 clause (b) is therefore unconstitutional 
"'' 
and void. 
• 
PATANJALI 
SAsTRI C. J.-Whatever may be the pc>1t10n as 
regards the acquisition of money as such it is not correct to say 
that a law made under entry 36 of List II cannot authorise 
acquisition of choses in action like arrears 'of rent due from the 
tenants which are covered by the term "property" used in that 
entry and in art. 31. The view that .a payment in cash or in 
government bonds of half the amount of such arrears leaves the 
zamindar 
without 
compensation 
for 
the 
balance 
is 
equally 
fallacious. Section 4 clause (b) is not therefore ultra vires or un-
constitutional.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
[1952J 
Per 
MAHAJAN, MuKHERJEA and 
CHANDRASEKHAllA AIYAR JJ. 
(PATANJALI SAsTRI C. J. and DAs J. dissenting).-&xtion 23 (b) 
of the Act which provides for a deduction on a percentage basis 
out of the gross asserts for "costs of works of benefit to 
the 
raiyat", is ostensibly enacted under entry 42 of List III, but it is 
merely a colourable piece of legislation, a mere device to 
reduce 
the gross assets, which does not really come under entry 42 and 
is unconstitutional. 
PATANJALI 
SAsTRI C. 
J. and 
DAs J.-The 
zamindars are under an obligation to maintain and repair the 
minor irrigation works in their villages which arc beneficial to 
the raiyats and the cost of such works is therefore a perfectly 
legitimate deduction 
in computing the 
net assets of the estate 
and sec. 23(f) is not unconstitutional. Further, as a payment of 
compensation is not a 
justiciable issue in the 
case of the 
im~ 
pugned statute, having regard to arts. 
31 (4), 31-A and 31-B, 
it 
is not open to the 
Court to enquire whether a reduction which 
results in reducing the compensation is unwarranted and there· 
fore a fraud on the Constitution. 
Per MAHAJAN J.-The phrase "public purpose" hao to be 
construed according to the spirit of the times in which the parti-
cular legislation is enacted and so construed, acquisition of estates 
for the purpose of preventing the concentration of huge blocks of 
land in the hands of a few individuals and to do away with 
intermediaries is for a public purpose. 
-Per DAs J.-No hard and fast definition can be laid down 
as to what is a "public purpose" as tho concept has been 
rapidly changing in all countries, but it is clear that it is the 
presence of the element of general interest of the community 
in 
an object or an aim that transforms such object or aim into a 
public 
purpose, 
and 
whatever 
furthers 
the general 
interest 
of the community as opposed to the particular interest of the 
individual must be regarded as a pnblic purpose.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
The Madhya Pradesh 
Abolition 
of 
Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) 
(No. I of 1951), and 
[1952] 
Proprietary 
Act, 1950 
The Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land 
Reforms Act, 1950 (U. P. Act No. I of 1951) 
(hereinafter referred to as the Bihar Act, the Madhya 
Pradesh Act and the Uttar Pradesh Act, respectively). 
The common aim of these statutes, generally speak-
ing, is to 
abolish zamindaries and other proprietary 
estates and tenures in the three States aforesaid, so as 
to eliminate the intermediaries by means of compul-
sory acquisition of their rights and interests, 
and 
to 
bring the raiyats and other occupants of lands in those 
areas into direct relation with the Government. The 
constitutionality of these Acts having been challenged 
in the respective State High Courts on nrious grounds, 
the Bihar Act was declared unconstitutional and 
void 
on the ground that it contravened article 14 of the 
Constitution, the other grounds of attack being reject-
ed while the other two Acts were adjudged constitu-
tional and valid. The appeals are directed against 
these decisions. 
Petitions have also been filed in this 
Court under article 32 by certain other zamindars 
seeking determination of the same issues. The common 
question 
which arises for consideration 
in all these 
appeals and petitions is whether the three State Legis-
latures, whch respetively passed the three 
impugned 
statutes, were 
constitutiona\.ly 
competent 
to enact 
them, though some special points are also involved in 
a few of these cases. 
As has been stated, various grounds of 
attack 
were put forward in the courts below, and, all of 
them having been 
repeated 
in 
the 
memoranda 
of appeals and the petitions, they would have requir-
ed consideration 
but for 
the 
amendment 
of 
the 
Constitution by the Constitution (First Amendment) 
Act, 1951 (hereinafter referred to as the 
Amendment 
Act) which was 
passed 
by the 
provisional Parlia-
.._. 
ment 
during 
the 
pendency 
of 
these 
proceedings. 
That Act by inserting the new articles 31-A and 
-
.. 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
893 
31-B purported to protect, generally, all laws 
provid-
ing for the acquisition of estates or interes.ts therein, 
and specifically, certain 
statutes, including the 
three 
impugned Acts, from attacks based on article 13 read 
with other relevant articles of Part III of the Consti-
tution. 
And the operation of these articles was made 
retrospective by providing, in section 4 of the Amend-
ment Act, that article 31-A shall be "deemed always 
to have been inserted" and, in article • 31-B, that 
none of the specified' statutes "shall be deemed ever 
to have become void". The validity of the Amend-
ment Act was in turn challenged in proceedings insti-
tuted in this Court under article 32 but was upheld 
in Sankari Prasad Singh Dea v. Union of India and 
State of Bihar(1). The result is that the impugned 
Acts can no longer be attacked on the ground of alleg-
ed infringement of any of the rights conferred by the 
provisions of Part III. 
It will 
be noted, however, that articles 31-A 
and 
31-B afford only limited protection against one ground 
of challenge, namely that the law in question is "in-
consistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the 
rights conferred by any provisions of this Part". This 
is made further clear by the opening words of article 
31-A "notwithstanding anything in the foregoing 
pro-
visions of this Part". 
The Amendment Act thus pro-
vides no immunity from attacks based on the lack of 
legislative competence under article 246, read with the 
entries in List II or List III of the Seventh Schedule to 
the Constitution to enact the three impugned 
statutes, 
as the Amendment Act d!d not in any way affect the 
Lists. 
Mr. P. R Das, leading counsel for the zamin-
dars, accordingly based his main argument in these 
proceedings on entry 36 of List II and entry 42 of 
List III which read as follows : 
"36. Acquisition or requisitioning 
except for the purposes of the Union, 
Provisions of entry 42 of List III. 
of 
property, 
subject 
to the 
42. Principles on which compensation

[1952] 
or of a State or for any other public purpose is to be 
determined, and the form and the manner . in which 
such compensation is to be given". 
The argument may be summarised thus. 
Entry 36 
of List II read with article 246(3) was obviously in-
tended to authorise a State Legislature to exercise the 
right of eminent domain, that is, the right of compul-
sory acquisition of private property, The exercise of 
such power has been recognised in· the jurisprudence of 
all civilised countries as conditioned by public 
neces-
sity and payment of compensation. 
All legislation 
in 
this country authorising such acquisition 
of property 
from Regulation I of 1824 of the Bengal Code down 
to the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, proceeded on that 
footing. 
The existence of a public purpose 
and an 
obligation to pay compensation being thus the neces-
sary concomitants of compulsory acquisition of 
private 
property, the term "acquisition" must be construed 
as importing, by necessary implication, the two condi-
tions aforesaid. It is a recognised rule for the con-
struction of statutes that, unless the 
words 
of 
the 
statute clearly so demand, a statute is not to be con-
strued · so as to take away the property of a subject 
without 
compensation : 
Attorney-General 
v. 
De 
Keyser's Royal Hotel(1 ). The power to take compulsorily 
raises by implication a right to payment ; Central 
Control Board v. Cannon Brewery('). The words "sub-
ject to the provisions of entry 42 of List III" in entry 36 
reinforce the argument, as these words must be 
taken 
to mean that the power to make a law with respect to 
acquisition of property should be exercised subject 
to 
the condition that such law should also 
provide for 
the matters referred to in entry 4 2, in other words, a 
two-fold restriction as to public purpose and payment 
. of compensation (both of which are referred to in 
·entry 42) is imposed on the exercise of the law mak-
ing power under entry 36. 
In any case, 
the legisla-
tive power conferred under entry 42 is a power coupl-
ed with a duty to exercise it for the benefit of the 
owners whose 
properties 
are 
compulsorily acquired

;under a law made under entry 36. For all these 
reasons the State Legislatures, it was claimed, had no 
power to make a law for acquisition of property with-
out fulfilling the two conditions as to public purpose 
.and payment of compensation. 
On the basis of these arguments, counsel proceeded 
to examine elaborately various 
provisions of the im-
pugned Acts with a view to show that the compensation 
which they purport to provide has, by "various shifts 
:and contrivances", been reduced to an illusory figure 
as compared with the market value of the properties 
acquired. 
The principles laid down for the com-
putation of 
compensation 
operated 
m 
reality 
as 
·"principles 
of 
confiscation", 
and 
the 
enactment 
of the statutes was in truth a "fraud on the Constitu-
tion", 
each of them being a colourable legislative 
.expedient for taking private properties , without 
pay-
ment of compensation in violation of the Constitution, 
while pretending to comply with its 
requirements. 
Nor were, these statutes enacted for 
any public 
pur~ 
pose ; their only purpose and effect was to destroy the 
dass of zamindars and tenure-holders and make 
the 
Government a "super-landlord". 
While such an 
aim 
might commend itself as a proper policy to be pur-
sued by the politkal party in power, it could not, in 
law, be regarded as a public purpose. 
Mr. Somayya, who appeared for some of the zamin-
-dars in the Madhya Pradesh group of cases, while 
adopting the arguments of Mr. Das, put forward an 
additional ground of objection. 
He argued that 
the 
impugned Acts were not passed in accordance with 
the procedure 
prescribed 
in 
article 
31 (3) 
which 
·provides 
"No such law as is referred to in clause (2) made 
:by the Legislature of a State shall have effect unless 
such law, having been reserved for the consideration 
of the President, has received his assent". 
Learned counsel stressed 
the 
words "law" and 
·•'legislature" and submitted that, inasmuch 
as the 
legislature of a State included

ments of article 31 (3) and so could not have "effect". · 
This ground of attack, it was claimed, was not exclud-
'ed by article 31-A or article 31-B as it was not based 
on infringement of fundamental rights. 
Dr. Ambedkar, who appeared for some of the zemin-
dars in the Uttar Pradesh batch of cases, advanced 
a· 
different line of argument. He· placed no reliance upon 
entry 36 of List II or entry 42 of List III. He appear-
ed to concede what Mr. Das so strenuously 
contested, 
that those entries, 
concerned as they 
were 
with the 
grant of power to the State Legislature to legislate 
with respect to matters specified therein, could not be 
taken, as a matter of construction, to import an obli--
gation to pay compensation. 
But he maintained 
that 
a constitutional prohibition against 
compulsory 
acqui-
sition of property without public 
necessity 
and pay-
ment of compensation was deducible from 
what he-
called the "spirit of the Constitution", which, accord-
ing to him, was a valid test for judging the constitutio-
nality of a statute. 
The Constitution, being avowedly 
•one for establishing liberty, justice and equality and' 
a government of a free people with only limited powers, 
must be held to contain an implied prohibition against 
taking 
private · property without just 
compensation· 
and in the absence of a public purpose. He relied on· 
certain· American decisions. and text books as support-
ing the view that a constitutional prohibition can be 
derived by implication from the 
spirit of 
the 
Con-· 
stitution 
where no 
expr~s 
prohib~tion has 
been 
enacted in that behalf.

only objections 
bas~d on alleged infringements of the 
fundamental rights conferred by Part III, but if, from 
the other provisions thereof it could be inferred that 
there must be a public purpose and payment of com-
pensation before private property could be compul-
sorily acquired by the State, there was npthing in the 
two articles aforesaid to preclude objection on the 
ground that the impugned Acts do not satisfy these 
requirements and are, therefore, unconstitutional. 
In addition to the aforesaid grounds of attack, which 
were common to all the three impugned statutes, 
the 
validity of each of them or of some specific provisions 
thereof was Aliso challenged on some special grounds • 
It will be convenient to deal with them after disposing 
of the main contentions summarised above which are 
common to all the three batches of case~. 
These contentions are, in my judgment devoid of 
of substance and force and I have no hesitation in 
rejecting them. 
The fact of the matter is the zemin-
dars lost the battle in the last round when this Court 
upheld the constitutionality of 
the 
Amendment Act 
which the Provisional 
Parliament enacted 
with 
the 
object, among others, of putting an end to this 
litigation. And it is no disparagement to their learned 
counsel to say that what remained 
of 
the 
compaign 
has been fought with such weak arguments 
as over-
taxed ingenuity could suggest. 
It will be convenient here to set out the material 
provisions of the Constitution on which the arguments 
before us have largely turned. 
Article 31 (2). 
No property movable or immovable 
........ shall be acquired for public purposes under any 
law authorising ........ such acquisition unless the law 
provides for compensation for the property .... acquired 
and 
either 
fixes the

specifies the principles on 
which 
and 
the 
manner 
i~ which the compensation is to 
be determined and 
given.

provisions of 
this 
Part, 
and 
notwithstanding 
any 
judgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal to 
the conuary, each 
of the 
said 
Acts 
and 
Regula-
tions shall, subject to the power of any 
competent 
Legislature to repeal or amend it, continue in force. 
It will be seen that the scope of article 31 ( 4) is at 
once narrower and wider than that 
of 
article 
31-A ; 
the former has application only to statutes which were 
pending in the legislature at the commencement of the 
Constitution, whereas the latter is subject to no such 
restriction. 
Again, 
article 31 ( 4) 
excludes 
attack 
only on the ground of contravention of article 31 (2), 
while article 31-A bars objections based on 
contraven-
tion of other provisions of Part III as well, such as 
articles 14 and 19. 
This indeed was the 
reason for 
the enactment of articles 31-A and 31-B, as the words 
of exclusion in article 31(4) were found inapt to cover 
objections based on contravention 
of article 14. 
On 
the other hand, the law referred to 
m 
article 31(4) 
covers acquisition of any kind 
of 
property, 
while 
., 
article 31-A relates only to the acquisition of a parti-
cular kind of property, viz., estates and rights there-
in, and what 
is more 
important 
for 
our present 
purpose, the non obstante clause in article 31 ( 4) over-
rides all other provisions in the Constitution including 
the List of the Seventh Schedule, whereas a law which 
falls within the purview of article 31-A could 
only 
prevail over "the foregoing provisions of this Part". 
Now, the three impugned statues 
fall 
within 
the 
" 
ambit of both article 31 ( 4) and articles 31-A and 31-B. 
Putting aside the later articles for the moment, it is 
plain that, under article 31 ( 4), the three impugned 
statutes are protected from attack in any court on the 
• 
ground that they contravene the provisions of article 
31(2). 
These provisions, so far as they are material 
here, ~ ·e (i) that a law with respect to acquisition of 
• property

(ii) was a "provisi9n" of article 31(2), submitted that 
( i) was not. 
According to him clause (2) 
assumed 
but did not "provide" 
that 
acqms1t10n 
should 
be 
authorised only for a public purpose. I cannot accept 
that view. 
In my opinion, the clause seeks also 
to 
impose a limitation in regard to public purpose. 
The 
clause was evidently worded in that form as 
it 
was 
copied (with minor variations) from section 299 (2) of 
the Govesrnment of India Act, 1935, which was un-
doubetedly designed to give effect to the recommenda-
tion of the Joint Parliamentary Committee in para. 369 
of their Report that two conditions should be imposed 
on expropriation 
of 
private 
property : "We think 
it (the provision proposed) should secure that legisla-
tion expropriating or authorising the expropriation of 
the property of private individuals should 
be lawful 
only if confined to expropriation for 
public purpose 
and if compernation, is determined either in the first 
instance or in appeal by some independent authority". 
It is thus clear that section 299(2) was intended to 
secure fulfilment of two conditions subject to which 
alone legislation authorising 
expropriation 
of 
private 
property should be lawful, and it seems reasonable to 
conclude th_at article 31 (2) was 
also 
intended 
to 
impose the same two conditions 
on 
legislation ex-
propriating 
private 
property. 
In 
other 
words, 
article 31 (2) must be understood as also 
providing 
that legislation 
authorising 
expropriation 
of 
private 
property should be lawful only if it was required for 
a public purpose and provision was made 
for 
pay-
ment of compensation. 
Indeed if this were 
not so, 
there would be nothing in the Constitution to prevent 
acquisition for a non-public or private purpose 
and 
without payment of compensation-an 
absurd 
result. -
• 
It cannot be 
supposed 
that the 
framers 
of 
the 
Constitution, while expressly 
enacting one of the 
two well-established restrictions 
on the 
exercise 
of 
the right of eminent domain, left 
the other 
to be 
imported from the common law. 
Article 
31 (2) 
must therefore, be taken to 
provide 
for 
both 
the 
limitations in express terms.

ground of contravention of tliese 
provlSlons 
im-
plies that the law m 
question 
authorises 
acquisition 
without reference to a public purpose and 
without 
payment 
of 
compensation. 
This was precisely the 
objection raised both by Mr. Das and Dr. Ambedkar 
to the constitutional validity of the impugned statutes, 
and such objection really amounts 
to calling 
those 
laws in question on the ground that they contravened 
the provisions of article 31 (2), though learned counsel 
stoutly denied that they were relying on the 
provi-
sions of article 31(2). The denial, however, seems to 
me to be based on a quibbling distinction without a 
difference in substance. Their main attack was really 
grounded on the absence of these two 
essential .. ~re­
requisites of valid 
legislation 
authorising 
acqms1t1on 
of private property, though Mr. Das 
would 
deduce 
them by implication from entry 36 of List II and 
entry 42 of List III, while Dr. Ambedkar sought 
to 
derive them from the spirit of the Constitution. 
But 
this is only a form of stating the objection which, in 
substance, is that the statutes are bad because of the 
absence of a public purpose and the omission to 
pro-
vide for a just compensation. 
This, in fact, was the 
burden of the argument before us. 
If, then, these two 
grounds of attack fall within the purview of article 
31 ( 4), the words "notwithstanding anything 
m 
this 
Constitution" are apt to exclude such grounds 
how-
soever they are derived-whether from the entries in 
the legislative Lists or from the spirit of the Constitu-
tion-for both alike 
are covered 
by those 
words. 
Indeed, if the objection based on the absence 
of 
a 
public purpose and of a provision for just compensa-
tion were still to be open, clause ( 4) of article 31 would -
be meaningless surplusage. It 
is obvious that 
that 
clause was specially designed to protect the impugned 
statutes and other laws similarly enacted from attack 
in a court of law on the aforesaid grounds and, if they 
were nevertheless to be considered as not being within 
the protection, it is difficult to see what the use 
of 
article 31 ( 4) would be. Learned counsel were unable 
to suggest any. 
The fact is that article 31 ( 4) was

designed to bar the jurisdiction 'of courts to entertain 
objections to the validity of a certain class of enact-
ments on the two fold ground referred to above, and 
its 
whole 
purpose 
would 
stand 
defeated if 
the 
zemindars' contention were to prevail. 
Even if it were open to the 
court to consider 
these grounds of objection, they are, in my op1mon, 
unsustainable. 
As po!nted out already, 
article 
31-A 
operates as an except10n to article 31 (2) 
read with 
article 13, only in respect of laws authorising ac-
quisition 
of 
"estates" 
and 
rights 
thdein, 
and 
this exception is to be deemed to have been part of 
the Constitution from its commencement. But it has 
no application to laws authorising acquisition of other 
kinds of property and, as regards these, the require-
ments as to public purpose and payment of compen-
sation are still enforced by the express provisions 
of 
article 31(2). 
In the face of the limitations on the 
State's power of compulsory acquisition t'hus incor-
porated in the body of the Constitution, from which 
"estates" alone are excluded, it would, in my opinion, 
be contrary 
to elementary canons of statutory con-
struction to read, by implication, 
those 
very 
limita-
tions into entry 36 of List II, alone or in conjunction 
with entry 42 of list III of the Seventh Schedule, or to 
deduce them from "the spirit of the Constitution", 
and that, 
c too, in 
respect 
of the very 
properties 
excluded. 
It is true that under the common law of eminent 
domain as recognised in the jurisprudence of all civi-
lized countries, the State cannot take the property of 
its subject unless such property is required for a public 
purpose and without compensating the owner 
for its 
loss. 
But, when these limitations are expressly 
pro-
vided for and it is further enacted that no 
law shall 
be made which takes away or 
abridges 
these 
safe-
guards, and any such law, 
if made, shall be void, 
there can be no room for implication, and the words 
"acquisition of property" must be understood in 
their 
natural sense of the act of acquiring property, without 
importing into 
the 
phrase 
an obligation 
to 
pay

compensation or a condition as 
to the existence of a 
public 
purpose. 
The entries in the 
Lists 
of 
the 
Seventh Schedule are designed to define and 
delimit 
the respective areas of legislative competence 
of the 
Union and State Legislatures, 
and such 
context 
is 
hardly appropriate for the imposition of implied res-
triictions on the exercise of legislative powers, 
which 
are ordinarily matters for positive enactment in 
the 
body of the Constitution. 
There are indications in article 31 itself to show 
that 
the 
expression 
"acquisition 
of 
property 
in 
entry 36 of list II does not in itself carry any obli-
gation to 
pay 
compensation. 
Clause (4) of 
that 
article 
postulates 
a 
"law" 
authorising 
acquisition 
of 
property 
but 
contravening 
the 
provisions 
of 
clause (2), that is, without a public purpose or pay-
ment of compensation. Similarly, clall!se (5) (b ), which 
excepts certain categories of "laws" from the opera-
tion of clause (2), contemplates· laws being made with-
out a public purpose or 
payment of 
compensation. 
Such laws can be made by a State Legislature only 
under entry 36 which 
must, therefore, 
be 
taken to 
confer a legislative power unfettered by any 
implied 
restrictions. 
~t was suggested that the laws referred 
to in sub-clause (b) of clause (5) are laws made in 
exercise of the taxing power or the police power of 
the State as the case may be, and that the sub-clause 
was inserted only by way of abundant caution. This 
is hardly a .satisfactory answer. Whatever may .be the 
position as to a taxing law, in regard to the source of 
legislative power, laws. under heads (2) and (3) of sub-
clause (b) must necessarily be referable to, and derive 
their competence from the legislative 
power 
under 
entry 36 of List II, in so far as they purport to autho-
rise acquisition of any property, for the police power 
of the State is only the general power to regulate and 
control the exercise of private rights and lioerties 
in 
the interests of the community and does not represent 
any specific head of legislative power. 
And even that 
answer is not available to Mr. Das in regard 
to 
clause ( 4).

Nor is the position improved for the zemindars by 
reading entry 36 of List II and entry 42 of List III te>-
gether. 
It was said that the words "subject 
to 
the 
provisions of entry 42 in List III" must be taken 
to 
mean that the law-making 
power 
under entry 
36 
could only be exercised subject to the two conditions 
as to public purpose and 
payment 
of compensation, 
both of which are referred to in 
entry. 42. 
Those 
words, in my opinion, mean no more than that any 
law made under entry 36 by a State 
Legislature can 
be displaced or overridden 
by 
the Union Legislature 
making a law under entry 42 of List III. Tha.t they 
cannot bear the interpretation sought to • be put upon 
them by Mr. Das is clear from the fact that 
similar 
words do not occur in entry 33 of List I which confers 
on Parliament the power of making laws with respect 
to acquisition or requisitioning of property 
for 
the 
purposes of the Union. 
For if the restrictive 
condi-
tions as to public purpose and pay_ment of compensa• 
tion are to be derived only from those words, then it 
must follow that in the absence 
of those words in 
entry 33, 
Parliament can 
make 
laws 
authorising 
acquisition or requisitioning 
of property 
without 
a 
public purpose and a provision for compensation. No 
reason was 
suggested 
why 
parliamentary legislation 
with 
respect to 
acquisition 
or 
requisitioning of 
property is to be free 
from 
such 
restrictive 
conC!i-
tions while State legislation should be subject to them. 
The fact is that the law-making power of both Parlia-
ment and State Legislatures 
can 
be 
exercised only 
subject to the aforesaid two restrictions, not by reason 
of anything contained in the entries 
themselves, 
but 
by reason of the positive provisions of article 31 (2), 
and, as laws falling under 
article 31 ( 4) or 
under 
articles 31-A and 31-B cannot be called in 
question 
in a court of law for non-compliance with those pre>-
visions, such laws cannot be struck down as uncon-
stitutional and void. 
It was further contended that the power to make a 
law under entry 42 of List III was a power coupled 
with a duty, because such law was obviously intended 
; 
.. > 
S.C.R.

for the benefit of the expropriated owners, and where 
the Legislature has authorised 
such 
expropriation, it 
was also bound to exercise the power of making a law 
laying down the principles 
on 
which 
such 
owners 
should be compensated for their loss. 
Reliance 
was 
placed in support of this somewhat novel contention on 
the well-known case of Julius v. Bishop of Oxford.( 1 ) 
That case, however, has no application here. 
While 
certain powers may be granted in order to be exer-
cised in favour of certain persons who are intended to 
be benefited by their exercise, 
and on that account 
may well be regarded as coupled with a duty to exer-
cise them when an appropriate 
occasion 
for 
their 
exercise arises, the power granted to a legislature to 
make a law with respect to any 
matter 
cannot 
be 
brought under that category. It cannot possibly have 
been intended that the legislature should be under an 
obligation to make a law in exercise of that power, for 
no obligation of that kind can be enforced by the court 
against a legislative body. 
Mr. 
Somayya's 
argument 
based -on 
clause (3) 
of article 31, 
to which reference 
has 
been made 
earlier, is equally untenable. 
It is 
true 
that 
the 
"Legislature" 
of a 
State 
includes 
the 
Governor 
and that 
a 
bill 
passed 
by 
such 
Legislature 
cannot become a law until 
it 
receives 
the 
Gover-
nor's assent. 
Article 200, however, contemplates 
one 
of three courses being adopted by the Governor when 
a bill is presented to him after it is 
passed 
by the 
House or Houses of Legislature : (1) to give his assent, 
or (2) to withhold as1sent, or (3) to reserve the bill for 
the consideration of the President. The first proviso, 
to that article deals with a situation where the Gover-
nor is bound to give his !lssent and has no relevance 
here. The second proviso makes 
reservation 
compul-
'Sory where the bill would, "if it became law", derogate 
from the powers of the High Court, but such reserva-
tion, it is important to note, should be made without 
the Governor himself giving his assent to the bill. It 
is significant that the article does not contemplate the 
(1) L.R. 5 H.L. 214.

Governor giving his assent and thereafter, when the 
bill has become a full-fledged law, reserving it for the 
consideration of the President. 
Indeed, the Governor 
is prohibited from giving his assent where such reser-
vation by him is 
made compulsory. 
The Constitu-
tion 
would 
thus seem 
to contemplate only "bills" 
passed by the House or Houses of Legislature being 
reserved for the consideration of the President and not 
"laws" to which the Governor has already given his 
assent. It was said that 
article 31 (3) 
provides a 
special safeguard which, in order to ensure that 
ne> 
hasty or unjust expropriatory legislation is passed by 
a State Legislature, requires for such legislation the 
assent of both the Governor and the President, and, to 
make this clear, the words "law" and "legislature" 
were deliberately used in clause (3). I am unable to 
agree with this view. 
The term "legislature" is 
not 
always used 
in 
the Constitution 
as 
including 
the 
Governor, though article 168 mak.es him a component 
part of the State Legislature. In article 173, for 
instance, the word is clearly used in the sense of the 
"Houses of legislature" and excludes the Governor. 
There are other provisions also where the word is used 
in contexts which 
exclude the Governor. Similarly 
the word "law" is sometimes loosely used 
in referring 
to a bill. Article 31 (4), for instance, speaks of a "bill" 
being reserved for the President's assent "after it has 
been passed" by the "legislature of 
a State" and of 
"the law so assented to." If the 
expression 
"passed 
by the 
legislature" 
were 
taken 
to 
mean "passed 
by the Houses of the 
legislature and 
assented 
to 
by the Governor" 
as 
Mr. 
Somayya would 
have 
it understood, then, it would cease 
to be a "bill" 
and could no longer be reserved as such. Nor is the 
phrase "law so assented to,' strictly accurate, 
as the 
previous portion of the 
clause 
makes 
it clear that 
what 
is reserved for the President's assent and what 
he assents to is a "bill" and not a law. The phrase 
obviouslv refers to what has become a law after recei-
ving 
the 
assent 
of 
the 
President. 
Similarly, 
article 31(3) must, in my judgment, be understood 
as -
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
909 
having 
reference 
to 
what, 
in 
historical 
sequence, 
having been passed by the House or Houses 
of the 
State Legislature and reserved by the Governor for the 
consideration of the President and assented to by the 
latter, has thus become a h1w. If it was intended that 
such a law should have the assent of both the Governor 
and the President, one would expect to find not only 
a more clear or explicit provision to that effect, but 
also some 
reference in article 200 to the Governor's 
·power to reserve a measure for the consideration of the 
President after himself assenting to it. 
On the other 
hand, as 
we have seen, 
where 
reservation 
by 
the 
Governor is made obligatory, he is 
prohibited from 
giving his assent. 
) 
In the view I have expressed above that the objec-
tions based on the lack of a public purpose and the 
failure to provide for payment of 
just 
compensation 
are barred under article 31(4) and are also devoid 
of 
of merits, it becomes unnecessary to consider what is 
a public purpose and whether 
the 
acquisition autho-
rised by the impugned statutes subserves 
any 
public 
purpose. Nor is it necessary to examine whether the 
scheme of compensation provided for by the statutes 
is so illusory as 
to leave 
the 
expropriated owners 
without any 
real 
compensation for loss of their 
.. 
property. 
.. 
Turning now to the special points ansmg in parti-
cular cases, it was urged by Mr. Das that section 4(b) 
of the Bihar Act, which provides that all arrears of 
rent, royalti~ and cesses due for any period prior to 
the date of the vesting of the estates in Government 
"shall vest and be recoverable by the State" was un-
constitutional and void. 
In the first place, there was 
no public purpose to be served by the acquisition of 
such property. 
The 
Government 
evidently 
lacked 
funds for 
the payment of even the illusory com-
pensation provided 
for 
in 
the 
Act, 
and 
accord-
ingly, 
hit 
upon 
the 
device 
of 
acquiring these 
arrears on payment of only 
50 per cent. 
of 
their 
value 
as 
provided 
in 
section 24.

[1952] 
for augmenting the Treasury could not be regard-
ed as a public purpose such 
as 
would justify expro-
priation of private property. Secondly, it was said that 
these 'arrears' would represent so much money when 
realised, and money could not be the subject of com-
pulsory acquisition as the obligation to pay compensa-
tion would practically turn such 
acquisition 
into a 
forced loan. 
Nor could the payment of 50 per cent of 
the face value of the arrears be regarded as compensa-
tion for the loss of the total arrears, for refund of one 
half of a sum of money taken away could never make 
good the loss of the balance. 
The argument proceeds 
on a misconception. Whatever may be the position as 
regards the acquisition of money as such, it 
is 
not 
correct to say that a law made under entry 36 of List 
II cannot authorise acquisition of choses in action like 
arrears of rent due from the tenants which are covered 
by the term "property" used 
in 
that entry and 
in 
article 31. 
It is equally fallacious to argue that a pay-
ment in cash or in Government bonds 
of 
half the 
amount of such arrears leaves the zemindar without 
compensation for the balance. 
It 
is 
unrealistic 
to 
assume that arrears which had 
remained 
uncollected 
over a period of years during which the zemindar as 
landlord had the advantage of summary remedies and 
other facilities 
for 
collection, 
represented 
so 
much 
money or money's worth in his hands when he was to 
cease to he a landlord and to have no longer those 
remedies and facilities. 
When allowance is made for 
doubtful and irrecoverable arrears and the trouble and 
expense involved in the collection of the rest of them 
the payment of 50 per cent. of the face value of the 
entire arrears must, as it seems to me, be considered 
reasonable and fair compensation for taking them over. 
Indeed, the contention leaves 
one 
almost wondering 
what aavantage the zemindars would gain by seeking 
to overthrow a provision in the Act which may well 
prove beneficial to them. However tillit may be, 
for 
the reasons already indicated, article 31(4) bars a 
challenge on these two grounds, and the objections to 
section 4(b) cannot be entertained.

An attack was also directed against section 23 (l)(f) 
which provides for a deduction on a percentage basis 
out of the gross assets as "cost of works of benefit to the 
raiyats of such· estate or tenure", in ascertaining the 
net assets on which compensation is to be based. 
It 
was said that there was no evidence to show that it was 
usual for the zemindars to 
incur 
such 
expenditure, 
and that the deduction was a mere contrivance to reduce 
the compensation payable for the acquisition of their 
estates. The provision for 
such deduction was there-
fore 
a 
fraud on 
the Constitution. 
The argument, 
however, overlooks 
the 
well-established 
obligation of 
the zemindars to maintain and repair the irrigation 
tanks and channels in the villages comprised in their 
estates. 
As the Privy 
Council pointed out in The 
Madras ~ilway Co. v. Zemindar of Carvatenagaram(1), 
"the zemandars have no power to do away with these 
tanks in the maintenance of which large numbers of 
people are interested, but are charged, under 
Indian 
law, by reason of their tenure, with the duty of pre-
serving and repairing them". 
These 
are, 
obviously, 
the works of benefit to the raiyats of the · estate, and 
their cost, which the zemindars are 
thus under an 
obligation to bear, is a perfectly legitimate 
deduction 
in computing the net assets of the 
estate. 
If the 
zemindars had, in the past, neglected this duty, that 
does not affect the propriety of 
the 
deduction before 
determining the compensation payable to 
them. 
It 
is, therefore, idle to say that it is a mere contrivance 
for reducing the compensation. 
This apart, if, 
as 
I 
have endeavoured to show, payment of compensation 
isi not a justiciable issue in the case of the impugned 
statutes, having regard to articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B, 
it is not open to the court to inquire whether a deduc-
tion which results in reducing the compensation is un-
warranted and therefore, a fraud on the Constitution. 
Lastly, Mr. Das turned his attack on section 32(2) 
read with section 43(2) (p). Under the former pro-
vision compensation was payable in cash or in bonds 
or partly in cash and partly in bonds. The bonds

were to be either negotiable or non-negotiable and non-
transferable and were payable in forty 
equal 
instal-
ments. Power was 
given 
to the State Government 
under section 43 (2) (p) to frame rules providing for 
"the 
proportion 
in which 
compensation 
shall be 
payable in cash and in bonds and the manner of 
payment 
of 
such 
compensation". 
It was argued 
that, whik' the Constitution conferred power 
on 
the 
legislatures under entry 42 of List III to make laws 
with respect to the 
principles 
on which compensa-
tiop for property acquired 
was 
to 
be 
determined 
and 
the 
form 
and the 
mauner 
m 
wji.ich such 
compensation was to be given, 
it 
was 
not 
com-
petent for the Bihar Legislature to delegate this essen-
tial legislative power 
to 
the executive 
government. 
Section 43 (2) (p) being thus void 
and inoperative, 
section 32 (2) must 
also 
fall to the ground, being 
vague and incapable by itself of being 'given 
effect 
to, <Jnd, as payment of compensation was an inextri-
cable part of the scheme of acquisition under the Act, 
the entire Act must go. 
I see no force in this argu-
ment. The legislature 
has applied its mind to the 
form in which compensation has to be paid and has 
fixed the number of equal instalments in 
which it 
should be paid. 
It has also 
provided for 
payment 
of interest on the compensation amount in the mean-
time. 
The 
proportion in which 
the compensation 
could be paid in cash and in bonds and the intervals 
between the instalments have been left to be 
deter-
mined by the executive 
government 
as 
tliose must 
necessarily depend on the financial resources 
of 
the 
State and the availability of funds in regard to which 
the executive 
government 
alone 
can 
have 
special 
means of knowledge. 
By no standard of permissible 
delegation can the vesting of such limited discretion 
by a legislature in an 
administrative body be held 
incompetent. The same remark applies to the delega-
tion of rule-making powers in regard to payment of 
compensation under the other two, Acts. 
It'was contended by Mr. Somayya that the Madhya 
Pradesh Act was not dU.ly passed as no question was 
put by the Speaker, at the third reading of the bilf, 
' 
•

on the motion that it be passed into law, as required 
by the provisions of rule 20 (1) of the rules governing 
legislative business then in force, and that the omis-
sion was not a mere "irregularity of procedure" which 
the court is barred from enquiring into under article 
212 (1) of the Constitution. 
Rule 20 (1) reads as fol-
lows: 
"A matter requiring the decision of the Assembly 
shall be decided by means of a question put by the 
Speaker on a motion made by a member". 
What appears to have happened is this. 
One of 
the Ministers moved 
that 
"The 
C. 
P. 
and Berar. 
Abolition of 
Proprietary 
Rights 
(Estates, Mahals, 
Alienated Lands) Bill, 1949, (No. 64 of 1949) as con-
sidered by the House be passed into law". 
Thereupon 
the Speaker read the motion to· the House, and this was 
followed by several speeches welcoming the measure, 
amid general acclamation in the House, as a great boon 
to the tillers of the soil. The official report of the pro-
ceedings prepared by the Secretary under rule 115(1), 
however, did not record that 
the 
Sepaker put 
the 
question in the usual form : "The question is etc." 
and that the motion was carried. 
It was argued that 
the official report being the only "authentic record of 
t11e proceedings of the Assembly" under rule 115(2), 
it must be taken to be 
conclusively 
established 
that 
the motion was not put to the House and carried by 
it. There is, in my opinion no substance in the objec-
tion. The original Bill signed and authenticated by 
the Speaker was produced before us, and it contains 
an endorsement by the speaker that the Bill was pass-
ed by the Assembly on 5th April, 1950. 
The endorse-
ment was signed by the Speaker on 10th May, 1950. 
The official report of the proceedings appears to have 
been prepared on 21st June, 1950, and was signed by 
the Speaker on 1st October, 1950. 
When he signed the 
report the Speaker did not apparently 
notice 
the 
omission as to tf:te motion having been put and carried . 
Such omission cannot, in the face of the explicit state-
ment by the Speaker endorsed on the Bill, be taken

to establish that the Bill was not put to the House and 
carried by it. In any case; the omission to put the 
motion formally to the House, even if true, was, in the 
circumstances, no 
more than a mere irregularity of 
procedure, as it is not disputed that the overwhelming 
majority of the members present and voting were in 
favour of carrying the motion and no dissentient voice 
was actually raised. 
Mr. Somayya raised a further contention that in 
regard to the malguzari lands covered by the Madhya 
Pradesh Act, articles 31-A and 31-B could 
be 
of 
no 
assistance to the Government, as 
such lands are 
not 
"estates" within the meaning of clause (2) of article 
31-A with the result that the 
objection 
based 
on 
article 14 as to discrimination in the matter of pay-
ment of compensation must prevail. It will be recalled 
that the High Court of Patna held the Bihar Act un-
constitutional as being discriminatory in 
providing for 
payment of compensation, and it 
was 
to 
overcome 
that difficulty 
that 
articles 
31-A 
and 
31-B 
were 
inserted in the Constitution. 
It 
was 
conceded 
by 
the learned 
,Advocate-General 
of 
'Madhya 
Pradesh 
that these malguzari lands 
could 
not be · regarded 
as estates within the meaning of 
article 
31-A read 
with the Tenancy Acts in force 
in Madhya Pradesh, 
but he contended that, inasmuch as article 31-B pur-
ported to validate specifically 
the 
Madhya 
Pradesh 
Act among others, and as that article was not limited 
in its application to estates, the objection could not 
prevail. Mr. Somayya, however, submitted 
that 
the 
opening 
words 
of article 
31-B, 
namely, 
"Without 
prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained 
in article 31-A" showed that the 
mention 
of 
parti-
cular statutes in article 31-B read 
with 
the 
Ninth 
Schedule was only illustrative, 
and that, 
accordingly, 
article 31-B could not be wider 
in 
scope. 
Reliance 
was placed in support of this argument upon the deci-
sion of the Privy Council in Sibnath Banerji's case('). 
I cannot agree with that view. 
There is nothing in 
article 31-B to indicate that 
the specific 
mention 
of 
(!) [1945] F.C.R. 195 (P.C.) 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
915 
certain statutes 
was 
only intended to illustrate the 
application of the general words of article 31-A. 
The 
opening words of article 31-B are only 
intended 
to 
make clear that article 31-A should not be restricted 
in its application by reason of anything contained in 
article 31-B and are in no way calculated to restrict 
the application of the latter article or of the enactments 
referred to therein to acquisition 
of 
" estates. " 
The 
decision cited affords no useful analogy. 
In some of the cases the estates sought to be acquir-
ed are situated in what was previously the territory of 
Indian States and belong to their former 
rulers. 
On 
the merger of those States 
in Madhya Pradesh 
or 
Uttar Pradesh, as the case may be, 
by 
virtue of the 
"covenant of merger" entered into between the rulers 
and the Government of India the properties in question 
were recognised to be the "private property" of 
the 
Rulers. In these cases it was urged that that estates 
sought to be acquired formed part of the Rulers' "per-
sonal rights" guaranteed to them under the instrument 
of merger, and that neither the impugned statutes nor 
the notifications· issued thereunder 
could deprive 
the 
Ruler of such properties in contravention 
of 
article 
362. 
The Attorney-General 
had several 
answers 
to 
this argument, including the bar under article 363 to 
interference by courts in disputes arising out of agree-
ments, covenants, etc., by Rulers of Indian States 
to 
which the Government of India was a party. 
But a 
short and obvious answer is that 
there 
was 
no 
contravention 
of 
any 
guarantee 
or 
assurance 
given by the 
Government 
under 
the 
covenant of 
merger, 
as 
the estates 
in 
question are 
sought 
to 
be acquired 
only 
as 
the 
"private 
property" 
of 
the Rulers and not 
otherwise. 
The compensation 
provided for, such as it is, is in recognition of their 
private proprietorship, 
as in the case 
of any other 
owner. There is, therefore, no force in this objection. 
In Appeal No. 285 of 1951 preferred by the Raja of 
Kapurthala, where a similar objection 
was 
raised, 
it 
was further alleged that the privy purse of the Ruler 
was fixed at a low figure in consideration of the Oudh

MAHAJAN J.-This is an appeal under article 132(3) 
of the Constitution of India from a judgment of the 
Full Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Patna, 
dated the 12th March, 1951, whereby the High Court 
declared the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, ultra vires 
on the ground of its infringement of article 14 of the 
Constitution, but decided against 
the 
respondent 
on 
all other points. 
On the 30th December, 1949, a Bill intituled 
the 
Bihar Land 
Reforms 
Bill 
was 
introduced in the 
Legislative Assembly 
qf 
Bihar and 
was 
passed by 
both the Houses of Legislature, and after having been 
reserved for the 
consideration 
of 
the 
President of 
India, received his assent on the 11th September, 1950. 
The Act was published in the Bihar Government 
Gazette on the 
25th 
September, 
1950, and 
on 
the 
same day a ·notification under section 1 (3) of the Act 
was published declaring that 
the 
Act would come 
into 
force 
immediately. 
On the 
same 
day, 
a 
notification under section 3 of the Act was published 
stating that the estates and tenures belonging to 
the 
respondent and two others 
passed 
to 
and 
became 
vested in th~ State of Bihar under the provisions 
of 
the Act. The respondent filed a petition in the High 
Court of Judicature at Patna under article 226 of the 
Constitution, challenging the 
constitutionality 
of

in the nature of mandamus to be issued on the State 
of Bihar restraining 
it 
from 
acting in 
any man-
ner by virtue 
of, or under 
the provisions 
of, 
the 
said 
Act. 
This application was 
heard along with 
three title suits and other similar applications filed by 
various zemindars of Bihar by a Special Bench of the 
High Court. 
By three separate but concurring 
judg-
ments, the Court declared the Act to be 
unconstitu-
tional and void on the ground of its infringement of 
fundamental right under article 14 of the Constitution. 
The validity of tl1e Act was attacked 
before 
the 
High Court on the following grounds : 
1. That the Bihar Legislature had no 
competence 
to pass it. 
2. That it contravened clause (I) of article 31 
of 
the Constitution. 
3. That the vesting of the estates in the State of 
Bihar under the Act being in effect an acquisition of 
the estates, it was invalid as that acquisition was not 
for a public purpose and the provision 
for 
compen-
sation was illusory. 
4. That it contravened 
article 
19(1) (f) 
of 
tht' 
Constit,ution. 
5. That some of its provisions were 
invalid 
on 
the ground of delegation of legislative powers. 
6. That it was a fraud on the Constitution. 
7. That it was unconstitutional as it 
contravened 
article 14 of the Constitution. 
The Court held as follows :-
1. That the Bihar Legislature was 
competent 
to 
enact the legislation. 
2. That the Act did not contravene 
article 31(1) 
of the Constitution. 
3. That the acquisition of the estates and tenures 
was for a public purpose. 
4. That the subject-matter of the Act fell 
under 
article 31 ( 4) of the Constitution.

During the pendency of the

against

Union 
Government 
with a view to put an end to the litigation 
of 
the

to

the 
Constitution and 
this 
was 
passed 
by the requisite 
majority as the Constitution (First

Act, 
1951. The zamindars brought petitions under article 
32 of the 
Constitution 
impugning 
the 
Amendment 
Act itself as unconstitutional 
and 
void. 
All 
these 
petitions were disallowed by this Court on 
the

of the Constitution does not survive and the Act 
is 
not open to challenge on any such ground. As 
the 
Act has been held' invalid by the High Court solely on 
the ground that it violated the provisions of article 14 
of the Constitution, the basis of the judgment declaring 
the Act to be unconstitutional is 
no longer tenable 
and it has therefore to be reversed in case this Court 
agrees with the decision of the High 
Court 
oii the 
points decided against the respondent. 
Mr. P. R. Das for the respondent 
frankily 
conceded 
that no objection to the validity of the Act at 
this 
stage could be 
raised on the ground that it contra-
vened any of the provisions of Part III of the Con-
stitution. He, however, supported the decision of 
the 
Court on grounds decided against him by that Court 
and urged the following points :-

SUPREME COURT REPORTS

1. That it was not within the competence of the 
Bih'\r State Legislature to enact the impugned Act. 
2. That the acquisition of the estates not being 
for public purpose, the Act was unconstitutional. 
3. That the legislative power in various sections of 
the Act has been abdicated in favour of the executive 
and such abdication of power was unconstitutional. 
4. That the Act was a fraud on the Constitution 
and that certain parts of the Act were unenforceable on 
account of vagueness and indefiniteness. 
The foundation of Mr. P. R. Das's attack on the 
vires of the Act mainly rests on the contention that it 
is implicit within the language of entry 36 of List II 
of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution that pro-
perty could not be acquired without payment of com-
pensation, the only effect of a compulsory power of 
acquisition against the individual being that there 
is 
the power to oblige him to sell and convey property 
when the public necessities require 
it, but that the 
power to take compulsorily raises 
by 
implication 
a 
right to payment ; in other words, there is a con-
comitant obligation to pay and the power to acquire 
is inseparable from the obligation 
to 
pay compen-
sation and as the provisions of the statute in respect 
of payment of compensation are illusory, it is uncon-
stitutional. 
As regards article 31 (2) of the Constitution, it is 
said that it deals with 
the 
fundamental 
right 
re-
garding property which is expressed in the clause in 
negative language. 
In entry 36 it is expressed in an 
affirmative form. 
The provisions of articles 31(4) and 
31-A and 31-B, though they deprive the expropriated 
proprietor of his rights provided in Part III 
of 
the 
Constitution, do not in any way affect the ambit of 
entry 36 and empower the State Legislature to make 
a law for compulsory acquisition of property without 
payment of compensation in the true sense of that term. 
Emphasis is laid on the words "subject to the provi-
sions of entry 42" contained in entry 36 
and it is 
contended that the exercise of legislative power under

[1952] 
entry 36 is conditional on exercise of power under 
entry 42, that one could not be exercised without the 
other and that the power conferred by the two entries 
had to be construed on the assumption that the acqui-
sitiop. was to be paid for. It is further contended that 
the legislative power in entry 42 is a power coupled with 
dnty which the legislature was bound to exercise for the 
benefit of the person whose property was taken in exer-
cise of the legislative power under entry 36. 
It is also 
said that the Bihar Legislature had 
legislated 
both 
under entry 36 and entry 42 and intended to take the 
property conditional on payment of compensation but 
if it transpires that the provisions it has made about 
payment of compensation are illusory, then that part 
of the Act would be void and as it could not have been 
intended by the legislature to 
pass 
the Act in 
any 
truncated form in which it would remain if the provi-
sions regarding compensation are taken out of it, the 
whole Act should be held unconstitutional. 
To appreciate the contentions raised by Mr. Das on 
the question of the competence of the Bihar 
Legisla-
ture to enact the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, it is 
necessary to refer to its provisions and to see on what 
subjects the legislature has 
purported 
to 
enact 
the 
law. 
The title of the Act indicates that the law provides 
for some kind of land reform in Bihar. 
Its 
preamble 
gives no indication as to the nature of these reforms 
except that it provides for 
the 
constitution 
of 
a 
Land Commission to advise the St:ite Government on 
the agrarian policy, 
whatever 
that 
expression 
may 
mean. 
The dominant purpose of the Act is that of 
transference to the State of the interests of proprietors 
and tenure-holders in land and of the mortgagees and 
lessees of such interests including the interests in trees, 
forests, fisheries, jalkars, ferries, huts, bazars, 
mines 
and minerals. Section 3 provides that the Government 
may, from time to time, by notification declare 
the 
estates or tenures mentioned therein to 
have 
passed 
and become vested in the State. 
Section 4 mentions 
the consequences of such vesting. 
It enacts that the 
• 
•

interests of the proprietor or 
tenure-holder in any 
building or part of a building comprised in such estate 
or tenure and used primarily as office or cutchery for 
the colletion of rent of such estate or tenure, 
and his 
interests in trees, forests, fisheries, jalkars, huts, bazars, 
and ferries and all other sairati interests as also his 
interest in 
the 
subsoil 
including 
any 
rights 
in 
mines and minerals, whether 
discovered 
or 
undis-
covered, or whether being worked or not, inclusive 
of such rights of lessee of mines and minerals, com-
prised in such estate or tenure (other than the interests 
of raiyats or under raiyats) shall 
vest 
absolutely 
in 
the State free from all incumhrances. 
Clause (b) pro-
vides that all arrears of rents, including royalties and 
all cesses together with interest, if any, due thereon for 
any period prior to the date of vesting, which were re-
coverable in respect of the estates or tenures of the 
proprietor or tenure-holder and the recovery of which 
was' not barred by any law of limitation shall vest in, 
and be recoverable by, 
the 
State. 
The 
expression 
"arrears of rent" includes arrears in respect of which 
suits were pending on the date of vesting or in respect 
of which decrees whether having the effect 
of 
rent 
decree or monev decree were obtained before the date 
of such vesting -and had not been satisfied 
and were 
not barred by limitation and also includes the 
costs 
allowed by such decrees. 
In other words, all outstand-
i11gs in the nature of rents 
and 
rent 
decrees that 
were due to the proprietors or 
tenure-holders 
before 
tJ1e date of vesting and before the State had any right, 
:itle or inkn.:st in the estate would also 
pass to it. 
·rhis seems to be a peculiar and rather extraordinary 
consequence of the vesting of an estate. 
Normally it 
has no relation to and cannot be regarded as an inci-
dent of the transference of tlie 
estates. 
The 
clause 
is m 
effect an independent provision 
laying 
down 
that monies due to the proprietor 
or 
tenure-holder 
during the period 
antecedent 
to the 
vesting 
and 
not realized by him but which were in the course of 
realization, whether by private effort or by means 
of 
pending

decree~ including the costs of those

In clause ( c) the liability of the proprietors or tenure-
holders for payment of arrears of revenue and cesses to 
th.e Government prior to the date of vesting is kept 
alive. 
The other consequences of vesting are that no 
suit can be maintained for 
recovery of 
any 
money 
from a proprietor or tenure-holder which is secured by 
a mortgage or charge on the estate and no such estate 
or tenure covered by the Act is liable to attachment. 
The Collector is entitled to take charge of the estate 
and to inspect the documents and accounts 
which 
he 
thinks necesisary to do for the management 
of 
the 
estate or tenure. 
Section 5 permits 
the 
proprietors 
and tenure-holders to 
retain 
their 
homesteads 
but 
only in the capacity of tenants free from the obliga-
tion to 
pay rent. 
Section 
6 allows them to retain 
possession of lands in their khas possession or in the 
possession of lessees under them, on payment of rent 
as raiyats to the State 
in the 
status of occupancy 
tenants. Section 
7 provides 
that 
buildings together 
with lands on which such buildings stand and in the 
possession of proprietors and tenure-holders and used 
as golas, factories or mills shall be retained by them 
on payment of rent. 
Section 8 gives a right of appeal 
to a party aggrieved against the Collector's order. 
In 
section 9 it is provided that all mines comprised 
in 
the estate or tenure as were in operation at the com-
mencement of this Act and were being worked directly 
by the proprietor or· tenure-holder shall he deemed to 
have been leased by the State Government to the pro-
prietor or tenure-holder. 
This section does not include 
within its scope mines on which considerable 
money 
might have been spent but which are actually not m 
operation. 
An artificial definition has been given 
m 
section (2) sub-clause (m) to the expression "mines in 
operation" as, meaning mines regarding the working 
of which notice has been served on Government under 
the Indian Mines Act.

Jay down the procedure for payment of those debts.

Certain directions 
are 
given 
in sections 20 and 21 regarding the procedure to

certain trusts have been created by

proprietor. 
Section 
22 
defines 
"previous 
agn-
cultural year" and 
the phrase 
"gross 
assets" 
with 
reference to a 
proprietor 
or 
tenure-holder. 
"Gross 
assets" in the Act means the aggregate of 
the 
rents 
including all cesses, which were payable in respect of 
the estates or tenures 
of such proprietor or tenure-
holder for the 
prevwus 
agricultural 
vear, 
whether 
payable by a subordinate tenant 
or · the 
raivats. 
Certain details are laid down for 
the 
assessment of 
those rents. 
In the exprnss1on 
"gross assets" 
1s also 
included the gross mcome of the prev10us agricultural 
year from fisheries, trees, jalkiars, ferries, huts, 
bazars 
.and 
sairati 
interests. 
Gross 
mcome from 
forests 
has to be calculated on the basis of the average gross 
annual income of 
twenty-five 
agricultural years pre-
ceding the agricultural year in which the date of vest-
mg falls, which in the opinion of a forest officer, the 
forests would have yielded if they 
had been placed 
during the 
said period of twenty-five years under the 
management of the State. 
Section 23 lays down the method of computation of 
net income. 
It provides 
that the net mcome 
of 
a 
proprietor or 
tenure-holder 
shall 
be 
computed by 
deducting from the gross asset of such proprietor or 
tenure-holder, as the case may be, the following :-

in 
respect 
of 
any agricultural

( c) any sum payable by such proprietor or tenure 
holder as income-tax in respect of any income derived 
from such estate or tenure, other than royalties for the 
previous agricultural year ; 
(d) any sum payable as chaukidari tax or muni-
cipal tax ; 
( e) cost of management of such estate or tenure 
at rates varying from five to twenty per cent. accord-
ing to the amount of the gross asset 
The lowest 
limit fixed is at Rs. 2,000, and the 
highest 
at 
any 
amount exceeding Rs. 15,000. 
These rates appear to have been fixed in an arbitrary 
manner bearing no relation whatsoeyer to the actual 
cost of management. 
To illustrate, in the case of the 
Maharaja of Darhhanga whose 
estate 
has 
a 
gross 
income of nearly forty-eight lakhs, the cost of manage-
ment, according to this calculation, would work out 
to a sum of nine an<l a half lakhs, which on the face of 
it looks starting; it 
can 
hardly 
have 
any 
relation 
to the costs 
actually 
incurred. 
The expense ratio 
under the head "management 
would 
ordinarily 
be 
lowest for the higheH gross income. 
It goes up 
m 
proportion to the reduction in the amount 
of gross 
income. The Act has, however, reversed 
this rule of 
economics with the result that part of the money that 
on the principles stated for determining compensation 
would be payable by way 
of compensation 
to 
the 
proprietor or 
tenure-holder 
stands forfeite<l 
by 
this 
artificial reduction .of the 
net 
income. 
Clause 
(f) 
provides for deduction from the gross assets of cost of 
works of benefit to the raiyats of such est2tes or tenures 
at rates varying from four to twelve and a haif per 
cent., the rate of four per cent. 
being 
applicable 
where the gross asset doos not exceed Rs. 5,000, and 
the rate of twelve and a half per cent. being applicable 
if the gross asset exceeds Rs. 25,000. 
It 
is 
obvious

S.C.R.

that the calculation of the cost of works 
of 
benefit 
to the raiyats at a flat rate 
without 
any 
reference 
to the actual expenses that might have been incurred 
is a provision of 
a confiscatory character. 
It 
arti-
ficially reduces the net income 
which 
is 
the 
basis 
of the assessment of compensation. The last clause (g) 
of this section allows deduction of any other tax or 
legal imposition, payable in respect of such 
estate 
or 
tenure not expressly mentioned in the earlier clauses. 
Section 24 provides the manner of 
determination 
of 
the compensation payable to the proprietor or tenure-
holder. It lays down a sliding scale for the assessment 
of compensation. 
Where the net 
income 
does 
not 
exceed Rs. 500, the compensation 
payable 
is 
twenty 
times the net income and where the net income com-
puted exceeds Rs. 1,00,000, it is payable at three times 
the amount. The compensation in such cases is merely 
nominal. In the case of the Maharaja of Darbhanga, 
the estate acquired also comprised land purchased by 
him by spending about a crore of rupees and also com-
pri.<Jed mortgages, to the tune of half a crore. All these 
vest in the Bihar 
State 
along with the inherited 
zemindari~ of 
the 
Maharaja 
and 
arrears 
of 
rent 
amounting to Rs. 30,00,000, while the total 
compen-
sation payable is ne:1rly a sum of Rs. 9,00,000. 
This 
section further 
provides that 
to 
the 
amount 
thus 
payable shall be added the amount of fifty per cent. 
of ~he arrears of rent referred to in clause (b) of sec-
tion 4 along with the amount 
of rnmpensation paya-
ble in respect of mines and minerals 
as 
determined 
under section 25. 
The section also 
lays down the 
method of assessment of compensation in the case of 
persons who have only a share in the zamindari or have 
other minor interests in the tenures or 
estates 
where 
i-he estate or tenure is held in the trust etc., or where they 
are of an impartible nature. In the case of mines and 
minerals the method of assessment is 
laid 
down 
in 
section 25. 
It has either to be fixed by agreement or 
by a tribunal appointed for the purpose.

[1952] 
lays down the method and manner 
of 
p~yment of 
compensation. 
Sub-section (2) of this 
section enacts 
that the amount of compensation shall be paid in cash 
or in bonds or part! y in cash and partly in bonds. 
The bonds shall be eitl-ier negotiable or non-negotiable 
and non-transferable and 
be payable 
in 
forty equal 
instalmen~s to the perrnn named therein 
and 
shall 
carry interest at two and a half per cent. per annum 
with effect from the date of issue. Any disputes about 
compensation between 
the 
proprietors 
or 
tenure 
holders have to be determined by a tribunal appointed 
by the 
State 
Government. 
Section 34 
provides for 
the constitution of a commission 
called 
the 
Bihar 
Land Commission. 
The other provisions of the Act 
are of a miscellaneous character and require no special 
mention. 
The 
last 
section 
authorizes 
the 
State 
Government to make rules for carrying out the pro-
visions of the Act. 
From this survey of the Act it appears that the 
law enacted might be taken to relate to several items 
in the legislative lists, i.e., rights in or over land and 
land tenures, forests, fisheries, 
mines and minerals, 
acquisition of property and also principles 
on 
which 
compensation for property acquired is to 
be 
deter-
mined. 
The pith and substance 
of 
the legislation 
however, in my opinion, is the transference of owner-
ship of estates to the State 
Governmeru 
and falls 
within the ambit of 
legislative 
head 
entry 
36 
of 
L>st II. 
There is no scheme of land reform within 
the framework of the statute except that a pious hope 
is expressed that the commission may 
produce 
one. 
The Bihar Legislature 
was 
certainly 
competent 
to 
make the law on the subject of transference of estates 
and the Act as regards 
such 
transfers 
1s 
con-
stitutional. 
The Act further deals with the realization of arrears 
of rents due before the date of vesting of the estates 
to the zemindars and forfeits fifty per 
cent. 
of such 
realization to the State exchequer. 
It also in an in-
direct manner forfeits the State exchequer part of the 
compensation money which would have been payable 
.

to the proprietors or tenureholders if the net income 
was not reduced by deduction from the gross income 
of items of artificial nature which have no relation to 
any actual 
expenses. 
Both 
these 
provlSlons 
will 
be separately dealt with hereinafter as, 
in my 
opi-
nion, the enactment of these provisions 
is uncon-
stitutional. 
Having held that the Bihar Act is constitutional as 
regards transfer of estates to the State and that this 
is mainly an enactment under legislative 
head 
36 
of 
Lis:t II, it is convenient now to examine the conten-
tion of Mr. Das to the effect that in the contents of 
the power conferred on the legislature by this entry 
their exists a concomitant obligation to pay compen-
sation and that as the provisions regarding payment of 
compensation are illusory, the Act i:s unconstitutional 
and that article 31 ( 4) of the Constitution does 
not 
afford any protection against this attack. 
For a proper appreciation and appraisal of the pro-
position of Mr. P. R. Das that the obligation to pay 
compensation is implicit in the language of entry 36 of 
List II of the Seventh Schedule and that the power to 
take compulsorily raises 
by 
implication a 
right to 
payment, the power to acquire being inseparable from 
the obligation to pay compensation, it is necessary to 
examine briefly the origin of the power of the State on 
the subject of 
compulsory 
acquisition 
of 
property. 
This power is a sovereign power of the State. 
Power 
to take property for public use 
has 
been 
exercised 
since olden times. 
Kent speaks of it as an inherent 
sovereign power. 
As an incident to thi,<; power of the 
State is the requirement that property shall not 
be 
taken for public use without just compensation. 
Mr. 
Broom in his work on Constitutional Law says, "Next 
in degree to the right of personal liberty is that of 
enjoying private property 
without undue 
interference 
or molestation, and 
the 
requirement 
that 
property 
shall not be taken for public use without just compen-
sation is but an aflirmance of the great doctrine esta-
blished by the common law for the protection of pri-
vate property. 
It is founded in natural equity and is

On the continent the power of compulsory acqms1-
tion is described by the term "eminent domain". This 
term seems to have been originated in 1625 by Hugo 
Grotius, who wrote of this power in his work "De Jure 
Belli et Pacis'' as follows : 
"The property of subjects is under the eminent 
domain of the State, so that the State or he who acts 
for it may use and even alienate 
and 
destroy 
such 
property, not only in the case of 
extreme 
necessity, 
in which even private persons have a right over the 
property of others, but for ends 
of 
public 
utility, 
to which ends those who founded civil society must 
be supposed 
to 
have 
intended 
that 
private 
ends 
should give way. 
But it is to be added that 
when 
this is done the State is bound to ·make good the loss 
to those who lose their property." 
The relationship between the individual's right 
to 
compensation and the sovereign's power 
to 
condemn 
is discussed in Thayer's Cases on Constitutional Law 
(Vol. I, p. 953) (mentioned on page 3 of Nichols on 
Eminent Domain) in these words .:-
"But while this 
obligation 
(to 
make 
compen-
sation) is thus well established and clear, let' it 
be 
particularly noticed upon what grounded it stands viz., 
. upon the natural rights of the 
individual. 
On 
the 
otht;.r hand, the right of the State to take springs from 
a different source, viz., 
a 
necessity 
of 
government. 
These two, therefore, have not the same origin ; they 
do not come, for instance, from any implied watract 
between the State and the individual, that the former 
shall have the property, if it will make compensation ; 
the right is no mere right to pre-emption, and it has 
no condition of compensation annexed 
to 
it: 
either 
precedent or subsequent ; but there is a right to take,

speaking, 
follows the other indeed like a shadow but it is yet 
distinct from it, and flows from another source." 
~horn of all its incidents,· the simple definition of 
the power 
to 
acquire compulsorily or of the term 
"eminent domain" 
is 
the power of the sovereign to 
take property for public use. without the owner's con-
sent. The meaning of the power in 
its 
irreducible 
terms is, (a) power to take, (b) without the owner's 
consent, ( c) for the public use. 
The concept of the 
public use has been inextricably related to an appro-
priate exercise of the power and is considered essen-
tial in any statement of its 
meamng. 
Payment of 
compensation, though not an essential 
ingredient 
of 
the connotation of the term, is an essential element 
of the valid exercise of such power. 
Courts 
have 
defined 
"eminent domain" so 
as 
to 
include 
this 
universal J imitation as an essential 
constituent of its 
meaning. Authority is 
universal 
m 
support 
of the 
amplified definition 
of 
"eminent domain" 
as 
the 
power of the sovereign to take property for 
public 
use without the owner's consent 
upon 
making 
just 
com pensa ti on. 
It is clear, . therefore, that the obligation for pay-
ment of just compensation is a necessary incident of 
the power 
of 
compulsory 
acquisition 
of 
property, 
both under the doctrine of the English Common Law 
as well as under the continental doctrine of eminent 
domain, subsequently adopted in America. 
The question 
for 
consideration 
is 
whether this 
obligation 
to 
pay 
compensation 
for 
compulsory 
acquisition of property has been impliedly laid down 
by the constitution makers in our Constitution under 
legislative head in entry 36 of List II and entry 33 of 
List I, or whether this all important obligation which 
follows ocmpulsory acquisition as a shadow has been 
put in express and clear terms somewhere else in the 
Constitution. To 
my 
mind, 
our 
Constitution has 
raised this obligation to 
pay 
compensation for

' 
compulsory acquisition of property to the status of. 
a 
fundamental right and it has declared that 
a 
law 
that does not make provision for payment of compen-
sation shall be void. It did not leave the matter 
to 
be discovered and spelt out by learned arguments at 
the Bar from out of the contents of entry 36 ; they 
explicitly provided for it in article 31 (2) 
of 
the 
Constitution. 
As the obligation 
to pay 
has 
been 
made a compulsory part of a statute that purports to 
legislate under entry 33 of List I and entry 36 
of 
List II, it is not possible to accede to the contention 
of Mr. P. R. Das that the duty to pay compensation 
is a thing inherent in the language of <;l).try 36. . I 
agree 
with the learned 
Attorney-General 
that 
tlY.: 
concept of acquisition and that of compensation 
are 
two different notions having their origin in different 
sources. 
One is founded on the sovereign power of 
the State to take, the other is based on the natural 
right of the person who is dqirived of property to be 
compensated for his loss. 
One is the power to take, 
the other is the condition flor the exercise of tl1at 
power. 
Power to take was mentioned 
in 
entry 36, 
while the condition for the exercise of· that power 
was embodied in article 31 (2) and there was no duty 
to pay compensation implicit in the content of 
the 
entry itself. 
Reference m this connection may be made to the 
Government of India Act, 1935. 
By section 299 of 
that statute a fetter was imposed on the power of 
legislation 
itself. 
The 
Constitution, 
however, 
de-
clared laws not providing for compensation · as 
void 
and it not only placed a fetter on the power of legis. 
lation but it guaranteed the expropriated 
proprietor a 
remedv in article 32 of the Constitution for enforce-
ment 
0of his fundamental right. 
I am therefore of the 
opinion that Mr. Das is not right in 
his contention 
that unless adequate provision is made by a law en-
acted under legislative power conferred by entry 36 of 
List I for compensation, the law is 
unconstitutional 
as entry 36 itself does not authorize the making of 
such a law without providing for compensation. Then 
,, 
S.C.R .• 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
931 
it was said that entry 36 of List II was linked up with 
entry 42 of the Concurrent List by the words "subject 
to" occurring therein and that the validity of any law 
mad<'. in exercise of legislative power under entry 36 
was conditional on the simultaneous exercise of the 
legislative power under entry 42 
and 
because 
there 
has been no valid exercise of 
this 
power (the pro-
visions of the impugned Act regarding the determina-
tion of compensation being 
illusory), 
the 
legislation 
under entry 36 fails. 
In my opinion, this contention 
is unsound. 
The two entries referred to 
above 
are 
merely heads of 
legislation 
and 
are 
neither inter-
dependent nor complementary to one another. 
It is 
by force of the provisions of article 31 (2) that it be-
comes obligatory to legislate 
providing 
for 
compen-
sation under entry 42 of the Concurrent List in order 
to give validity to a law enacted under entry 36 and 
not by reason of the use of the words "subject to" in 
the wording of the entry. 
No such words occur 
in 
entry 33 of the Union List. 
It cannot reasonably 
be 
argued that Parliament could make a law for com-
pulsory acquisition of property for 
hs purposes with-
out fulfilling the condition of making 
a law under 
entry 42 of the Concurrent List, but a State Legis-
lature in this respect is in a different situation. 
Such 
a contention, in my opinion, is untenable. 
The only 
purpose of 
the 
words 
"subject 
to" 
occuring 
in 
entry 36 is to indicate that legislation under entry 36 
would be subject to any law made by Parliament in 
exercise of its legislative power under entry 42 of the 
Concurrent List. 
Both legislatures can legislate under 
entry 42 but 
the 
Parliamentary 
statute 
made 
in 
exercise of powers under this entry would 
have pre-
ference over a State law in case of repugnancy and it 
was for this reason that reference was made to entry 42 
in the head of legislation mentioned in the State List 
under entry 36. In other words, it 
only means 
that 
whenever a law is made by a State Legislature in exer-
cise of its legislative power under entry 36, that 
law 
will be subject to the provisions of a Parliamentary 
statute made in exercise of 
its 
legislative 
powers 
under entry 42 of the C'nncurrent List.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
[1952] 
Lastly, it was 
urged 
that the 
legislative 
power 
conferred in entry 42 of the Concurrent List is a power 
conferred for the benefit of the expropriated 
owner 
and that the legislature is 
bound 
to 
exercise 
this 
power for his benefit whenever it takes property under 
its compulsory powers, in other words, it 
was 
said 
that the power conferred by the entry was coupled 
with a duty to exercise it. 
Reference was made 
in 
this connection to the observations of Lord Cairns in 
Julius v. Bishop of Oxford(1). 
The principle of that 
decision is that where power is conferred in the nature 
of a trust there is an obligation to exercise it for the 
benefit of the cestui que trust. 
These o.bservations do 
not have any apposite application to the case of legis-
lative 
powers 
conferred 
by 
a 
constitution. 
The 
entries in the lists are merely legislative 
heads 
and 
are of an enabling character. 
Duty to exercise legis-
lative power and 
in 
a 
particular manner cannot be 
read ·into a mere head of legislation. If the argument 
of the learned counsel was sound, then it would 
be 
open to this Court to issue a mandamus to the legis-
lature to 
exercise 
its 
power of legislation under 
entry 42, if it failed to do so. 
Mr. Das, when faced 
with this question, had to admit that 
he 
could not 
seriously contend that a legislature could be 
directed 
to enact a statute if it did not wish to do so. 
Failure 
to make a law under entrv 42 cannot make a law 
made under entry 36 bad. 
Ii1 my opinion, the decision 
in the case of Julms v. Bishop of Oxford(') has no 
relevancy to the matter before us. 
The crucial point for determination in these appeals 
h to discover the extent to which article 31 ( 4) of 
the Constitution or the new articles 31-A 
and 
31-B 
have 
deprived the 
expropriated 
proprietor 
of his 
rights or remedies in respect of this matter and of the 
guaranteed right to get 
compensation 
for 
property 
acquired. Article 31(4) is in these terms:-
"If any Bill pending at 
the commencement of 
this Constitution in the legislature of 
a 
State 
has, 
after it has been passed by 
such 
Legislature,

his 
assent, 
then 
notwithstanding any- ' 
thing in this Constitution, the law so assented to shall 
not be called in question in any court on the ground 
that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2) ." 
Articles 31-A and 31-B are in these terms:-
"31-A. (1) Notwithstanding anything in the fore-
going provisions of this Part, no law providing for the 
acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights 
therein or for the extinguishment or 
modification 
of 
any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the 
ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or 
abridges any of the rights conferred 
by 
any 
pro-
visions of this Part : 
Provided that where such law is a law made by 
the Legislature of a State, the 
provisions 
of 
this 
Article

that 
ex-

[1952] 
to the contrary, each of the said Acts and Regulations 
shall, subject to the power of any competent legislature 
to repeal or amend it, continue in force." 
The language of article 31 ( 4) is unequivocal in its 
terms and states that when a Bill has received 
the 
assent of the President according 
to 
the 
procedure 
prescribed in article 31(3) and (4) then, notwithstand-
ing anything in this Constitution, the law so assented 
to shall not be called in question in any court on the 
ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2). 
In order to determine the scope of this clause, it is 
necessary to determine what are the specific provisions 
of clause (2) which clause ( 4) makes unjusticiable. A 
strict construction has to be placed on the language of 
this clause, it being in the nature of a debarring pro-
vision. 
In my opinion, the provisions 
of 
sub-clause 
(2) made unjusticiable by clause (4), relate to the 
determination and 
payment 
of 
compensation. 
The 
whole purpose of the clause is to make the obligation 
to pay compensation 
a condition 
precedent 
to the 
compulsory acquisition of property. 
The 
words 
of 
the clause preceding 
the word 
"unless" 
are 
merely 
descriptive of the law, the validity of which would be 
questionable if there was no provision for determina-
tion and for payment of compensation for the property 
taken in its contents. 
The use of the 
word "such" 
fully supports this interpretation. 
The 
mandate 
of 
the clause is that such a law must contain a provision 
for 
payment 
of 
compensation 
to the expropriated 
proprietor. 
According 
to 
the 
Oxford 
Dictionary, 
(Vol. 8, p. 1526) the 
expression 
"Provision" 
when 
used in statutes, has reference to 
what 
is expressly 
provided therein. 
What 
article 
31 ( 4) 
really 
says is 
that 
the 
contravention 
of 
the 
express 
provisions of article 31 (2) relating 
to 
payment 
of 
compensation will not be a justiciable issue. 
It has 
no reference to anything that may be implied within 
the language of that clause. The existence of a "public 
purpose" is undoubtedly an implied condition of the 
exercise of compulsory powers of acquisition 
by the 
State, but 
the language 
of article 31(2) 
does A not 
.. 
J 
.. ~ 
-. 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
935 
expressly make it a condition precedent to acquisition. 
It assumes that compulsory acquisition can be for a 
"public purpose" only, which is thus inherent in such 
acquisition. 
Hence article 31(4), in my opinion, does 
not bar the jurisdiction of the court from inquiring 
whether the law relating to compulsory acquisition of 
property is not valid because 
the acquisition is not 
being made for a public purpose. This is also the view 
taken by the learned Judges of the Patna High Court. 
The sovereign power to acquire property compulsorily 
is a power to acquire it only for 
a public purpose. 
There is no power in the sovereign to acquire private 
property 
in 
order 
to give 
it 
to 
private persons. 
Public purpose 
is 
a 
content 
of 
the 
power itself. 
Reference in 
this 
connection 
may 
be 
made 
to 
Willoughby's Constitutional Law (page 795). 
Therein 
it is stated. 
"As between individuals, 
no necessity, 
however 
great, no exigency, 
however imminent, 
no 
improve-
ment, however valuable, no refusal, however unneigh-
bourly, no obstinacy, however unreasonable, 
no offers 
of compensation, however extravagant, can compel or 
require any man to part with an inch of his estate." 
Public purpose is an essential ingredient in the very 
definition of the 
expression 
"eminent 
domain" 
as 
given by Nichols and other constitutional writers, even 
though obligation to pay compensation is not a content 
of the definition but has been added to it by judicial 
interpretation. The exercise of the power to acquire 
compulsorily is conditional on the existence of a public 
purpose and that being so, this condition is not an 
express provision of article 31(2) but 
exists 
aliunde 
in the content of the power itself and that in fact is 
the assumption upon which this clause of the article 
proceeds. 
The result of 
this 
discussion 
is that 
the 
scope 
of article 31 ( 4) is limited to the express provisions 
of 
article 31 (2) and courts cannot examine 
either 
the 
extent or the adequacy of the 
prov1S1ons 
of 
com-
pensation contained in any law 
dealing 
with

[1952] 
acquisition of property compulsorily for public purpose 
but the barring provisions of article 31(4) <lo not in any 
way touch the powers of the court to see whether the 
acquisition has been made for public 
purpose. 
The 
provisions of this clause also Jo not take away the 
court's power to examine whether the legislature that 
made the law has acted in exercise of its law making 
power within the lists or has merely made some other 
law though it has ostensibly exercised its powers under 
a certain legislative head which 
cannot 
be 
used to 
support the legislation. 
As regards the new articles 31-A and 31-B, they 
merely place beyond the reach of the c;ourt any enact-
ment dealing with compulsory acquisition 
of 
property 
which may infringe any of the provisions of Part III 
of the Constitution ; in other words, article 13(2) of 
the Constitution cannot be called in aid to impugn the 
validity of such statutes. 
Having determined the scope of article 31 ( 4), it is 
now convenie11t 
to 
examine 
the 
extent 
of 
the 
protection given by :i.rticle 31 (4) 
to the 
impugned 
statute. 
Mr. Das is to a great extent right in his contention 
-the point was not seriously challenged by the learned 
Attorney-Gcneral,-that the law 
under 
challenge 
in 
the matter of compensation is highly unjust or inequi-
table to certain persons and in certain matters, 
and 
compensation in some cases 
is 
purely 
illusory. 
Be 
that as it may, the Constitution 
in 
express 
terms 
prohibits an enquiry in a court of 
law 
into 
those 
matters. 
The same Constituent Assembly that provi-
ded the guarantees in article 31 (2) in respect of pay-
ment 
of 
compensation 
and 
provided 
the 
remedy 
.in article 32 for 
enforcing 
the· 
guaranteed 
right, 
took 
awav 
that rcmedv 
in the case of the Bihar 
and 
othe~ zamindari 
estates 
and 
substituted 
for 
it the procedure of article 31(3) and (4), compliance 
with which wonld be sufficient to make tbe laws valid 
and effective. 
However 
repugnant 
the 
impugned 
law may be to our sense of justice, it is not possible 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
937 
for us to examine its contents on 
the 
question 
of 
quantum of compensation. 
It is for 
the 
appropriate 
legislature to see if it can revise some of its unjust 
provisions which are repugnant to all notions of justice 
and are of an illusory nature. 
The courts' hands are 
tied by the provisions of article 31 ( 4) and that which 
has been declared by the Constitution in clear 
terms 
not to be justiciable, cannot be made justiciable in an 
indirect manner by holding 
that the 
same 
subject-
matter which is expressly barred is contained 
impli-
citly in some other entry and therefore open to exa-
mination. 
None of these provisions, 
however, 
fetter 
the power of the court to inquire into any other 
matters the cognizance of which is not expressly taken 
away by the provisions of clause (4) and articles 31-A 
and 31-B. 
Therefore, the material point for determination 
is 
whether the acquisition of the estates is tor any public 
purpose and if it be not so, the law can certainly be 
held to be unconstitutional. 
Mr. Das contended, and 
in my opinion rightly, that 
jurisdiction 
to 
acqmre 
private property by legislation can only 
be 
exercised 
for a public purpose. 
It may be the purpose of the 
Union, or the purpose of the State or any other public 
purpose. Private property cannot be acquired 
for 
a 
private purpose. 
The right to legislate under entry 36 
postulates the existence of a public purpose and the 
contention is that there was no public purpose 
behind 
the Act. 
The learned Judges of 
the 
High 
Court 
negatived this conten.tion on the ground that the ques-
tion whether there was a public purpose in support of 
the acquisition of the estates had been by implication 
decided by the Constituent Assembly 
and 
therefore 
the Court could not go into this matter. Shearer J. 
said as follows :-
"We are, in my opm10n, estopped from saying that 
the acquisition of estates and 
tenures is not an acqui-
sition for such a purpose. That it is, has been decided 
by the Constituent Assembly itself."

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
(1952] 
This decision was reached in view of the prov1S1ons 
of clauses (4) and (6) of article 31 which were inter-
preted 
to 
mean 
that the Constituent Assembly gave 
their express approval to this legislation. 
Reuben J. 
observed as follows :-
"From article 31, clause (2), it is clear that the 
Constituent Assembly considered 
two 
requirements 
as essential 
for 
compulsory 
acqumt10n, 
namely, 
a 
public purpose and provision for 
compensation. 
The 
protection 
which 
the 
Constituent Assembly 
gave 
under clauses ( 4) and ( 6) was confined to the latter 
requirement. 
Evidently, 
therefore, the 
Constituent 
Assembly thought that 
protection 
was not 
reqaued 
under the other head, that is to say, the Constituent 
Assembly regarded that nationalization of 
land 
as it-
self constituting a public purpose. 
I would, therefore, hold that there is a 
pose for the impugned Act 
within 
the 
clause (2) of article 31." 
Das J. said as follows :-
public pur-
meaning of 
"There is, I think, clear indication in the Constitu. 
tion of India itself that the expression 'public purpose' 
is to be understood in 
a wide 
and 
comprehensive 
sense. 
Furthermore, 
there is 
indication 
that 
the 
Constituent Assembly, representing the people of India 
which made the Constitution, was itself aware of the 
existence of legislation of the nature of impugned Act. 
This is clear from clause ( 4) of article 31. As a matter 
of fact, the Land Reforms Hill was pending 
at the 
commencement of the Constitution ........ If the legis-
lation then pending was not for a public purpose, it 
was, indeed, surprising that the Constituent Assembly 
tried to save such legislation by means of the provi-
sions of clause (4) of article 31. 
One may, I think, 
say that 
there was 
an 
implied declaration by 
the 
Constitue11t Assembly that such legislation was for a 
public purpose and such declaration 
will 
be 
given 
deference by the courts until it is shown to involve an 
impossibility.

For the reasons given above, I hold that 
the 
impugned Act does 
not fall 
for 
want of a public 
purpose". 
Learned counsel challenged this view of the High 
Court and contended that article 31 ( 4) of the Constitu-
tion is no answer on this point and that the Act was 
bad as it was silent on the question as to 
why the 
zamindaris were being acquired ; that it only provided 
for the interception of rents which instead 
of 
being 
realized by the zami11dars would . go into the coffers 
-0f the Government without any benefit being derived 
by the tenants ; that private property could 
not 
be 
acquired for merely augmenting the revenues of the 
State; and that the only purpose that could be gather-
·ed from this Act was the ruination of a large class of 
persons without any corresponding benefit to any sec-
tion of the community.

the possession 
and cultivation of the ryots and no 
part of the rent 
realisable from them 
Is being

for

It IS pointed out that the waste lands were. 
sufficient to 
meet the 
requirements 
of villagers for 
grazing (;attle and for pasture and that in effect 
the 
acquisition of the estates was for the purpose of crea-
ting one machine-ridden and 
red-tapist 
super-landlord 
by depriving a substantial portion of the public 
of 
their means of livelihood. 
The learned counsel proceeded to say that nationali-
zation ·of land may be the policy of the party in power 
·but this is not a public purpose which involves benefit 
to the community. 
Reference in this connection was 
made to the decision in Hamabai Pramjee

mean, must include a purpose, that is, an object or 
aim, in which the general interest of the community as 
opposed to the particular interest 
of 
individuals 
1s 
directly and vitally concerned. 
The impugned Act, 
it 
was contended, did not fall within this definition of 
"public purpose". 
Reference was also made to Vol. II 
of Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 
at 
page 
744, 
wherein it is said as follows :-
"The purpose must 
be 
public, 
and 
must 
have 
reference to the needs or convenience of the public, 
and no reason of general pnblic policy will be sufficient 
to validate other transfers when they concern 
existing 
vested rights." 
Finally, it was urged tl1at there was nothing definite 
or tangible in the Act or in the views of the legisla-
tures which gave any indication of the public purpose 
for which the estates were being acquired and all that 
could be gathered was that the legislature 
did 
not 
know its own mind at all and on a vague notion of some 
future policy directed the acquisition of the estates. 
In my opinion, it will not serve any useful purpose· 
to examine each and every argument that was address-
ed to us by the learned counsel. There can be 
no. 
manner of doubt that acquisition of private property 
by legislation under entries 33, 36 and 42 can only be 
made either for purposes of the Union or for purposes 
of the State or for a public purpose and that it is un-
•1ecessary to state in express terms in the statute itself 
tne precise purpose for which property is being taken, 
nrovided from the whole tenor and inten<lment of the 
Act it could be gathere<l that the property was being 
acquired either for purposes of the State 
or for pur-
poses of the public and that the 
intention was 
to 
benefit the community at large. It may be conceded 
that the present statute 
does not disclose the legis-
lature's mind as to what it would ultimately do after 
the 
estates 
arc vested in the 
State 
Government. 
Perhaps the State Government has not yet 
made 
up· 
.its mind how and for what purposes the lands and 
the tenures acqtiired will 
be 
utilized. 
The 
statute 
• •

S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
941 
provides m section 34 for the establishment of a land 
commission whose function it will be to advise the 
Government as to its agranan policy. 
Be that as it 
may, it seems to me that m spite of the criticism 
levelled against the Act by 
the 
learned counsel, it 
cannot be said that the Act would fall because it fails 
to postulate a public purpose. 
The Act 
1s 
intituled 
"The Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950". 
The preamble 
of the Constitution says that India has 
been 
con-
stituted 
into a 
Sovereign 
Democratic 
Republic 
to 
secure ·to all its citizens justice, social, economic and 
political. Article 
39 of 
the 
Directive Principles 
of 
State Policy states as follows :--
"The State shall, in particular, direct its policy 
t!owards securing that the ownership 
and 
control 
of 
the material resources of the community 
are so 
dis-
tributed as best to 
subserve 
the common good ; and 
that the operation of the economic system 
does not 
result in the concentration of 
wealth and 
means 
of 
production to the common detriment." 
Now it is obvious that concentration of big blocks of 
land in the hands of a few individuals is contrary to 
the principle on which the Constitution of 
India 
1s 
based. The purpose of the 
acquisition 
contemplated 
by the impugned Act therefore is to clo away with the 
concentrat;on of big blocks of land ancl means of pro-
duction in the hands of a few individuals and to so 
distribute the ownership and control of the 
material 
resources which come m the hands of the State as to 
subserve the common good as best 
as 
possible. In 
other wor<ls, shortly put, the purpose behind the Act 
is to bring about a reform in the 
land 
distribution 
system of Bihar for the general benefit of the commu-
nity as advised. 
The legislature is the best judge of 
what is good for the community, by whose suffrage it 
comes into existence and it is not possible for 
this 
Court to say that there was no public purpose behind 
the acquisition contemplated by the impugned statute. 
The purpose of the statute certainly 1s m accordance 
with the letter and spirit of the Constitution of India. 
It 
is fallacious to contend that the object of th1 Act is

to ruin five and a half million people in Bihar. 
All 
lands in khas possession of all these persons have not 
been made the subject-matter of 
acquisition. 
Their 
homesteads, tbeir mineral wealth except mines not 
in 
operation have not been seriously touched by the pro-
visions of the Act. 
Various 
other exemptions have 
also been made in their favour in the Act, apart from 
the provisions as to compensation which in the 
case 
of small zamindaris can by no means be said to be of 
an illusory character. It is <liflicult to hold in the pre-
sent day conditions of the world that measures adopt-
ed for the welfare of the community and sought 
to be 
achieved by process of legislation so far as the carry-
ing out of the policy of nationalization of land is con-
cerned can fall on the ground of want of public pur-
pose. 
The phrase "public purpose" has to he 
con-
strued according to the spirit of the times in which 
particular legislation is enacted and so construed, the 
acquisition of the estates has to be held to have been 
made for a public purpose. 
These observations. however, have 
no 
application 
to the acquisition 
of arrears 
of rent. 
On the face 
of the statute, acquisition 
of 
fifty 
per 
cent. 
of 
these 
arrears was for the private purpose 
of 
the 
zemindars and the other fifty per cent. 
was either 
for supplementing 
the revenues of the State or for 
securing 
means 
for 
payment 
of 
compensation 
to 
the zemindars. 
The purpose is to discharge the obli-
gation of 
the acquirer to pay 
the price. The same 
observations apply to clause 23 (f) of 
the 
statute. 
That provision has been made for 
the purpose of 
negativing partially the provisions of the Act regard-
ing payment of compensation. 
Clause ( 4) of article 31 
affords no protection against the invalidity 
of 
these 
clauses. 
The learned Attorney-General contended that the 
acquisition of arrears was an acquisition of choses in 
action and that the compensation paid for it was fifty 
per cent. of the amount of arrears. 
I regret I am un-
able to accept this suggestion. 
It is a well accepted

proposition of 
law that property 
of 
individuals can-
not be appropriated by the State under the power of 
compulsory acquisition for the mere purpose of adding 
to the revenues of the State. 
"The principle of com-
pulsory acquisition of property," 
says 
Cooley 
(in 
Vol. II at p. 113, 
Constitutional 
Limitations) 
"is 
founded on the superior claims 
of 
the 
whole 
com-
munity over an individual citizen but is 
applicable 
only in those cases where private property is wanted 
for public use, or demanded by 
the public 
welfare 
and that no instance is known in which it has been 
taken for the mere purpose of raising a revenue by 
sale or otherwise and the exercise of such a power is 
utterly 
destructive 
of 
individual 
right. 
Taking 
~10ney under the right 
of 
eminent 
domain, 
when 
1t must 
be compensated 
in 
money afterwards 
is 
nothing more or less than a forced loan. Money or 
that which in ordinary use passes as such and which 
the Government 
may reach 
by taxation, 
and 
also 
rights in action which can only be avai~able when made 
lo produce money, cannot be taken under this power." 
Willis in his 
Constitutional Law, at 
page 
816, 
offers 
the 
same 
opm1on. 
Nichols 
on 
"Eminent 
Domain" (Vol. I, at page 97) has expressed 
a 
con-
trary opinion and reference 
has been made to the 
decision in Cincinnati v. Louisville etc., R. Co. (1). An 
examination of this case, however, does 
not disclose 
that any such proposition was stated therein. 
It was 
held in that case that a Bill to restrain the enforce-
ment of a State statute regulating fire insurance· rights 
was a valid law in the State of Kansas. 
It was not 
necessary to decide in this case whether under the 
compulsory acquisition power the State has the power 
to acquire choses in action or money, but it cannot be 
. seriously disputed that such an acquisition amounts 
to a forced loan and that the desired result can be 
more appositely obtained 
in 
exercise 
of 
the 
police 
power of the State than of the power of eminent domain 
or compulsory acquisition of property , and that com-
pensation in such a case is the same amount of money

[1952] 
that is being taken and in the case of a chose in action 
the amount of money that it would produce. 
In this 
situation it cannot be held that fifty per cent. of the 
outstanding arrears was compensation in any sense of 
that expression for this acquisition. 
The true posi-
tion is that the State took over all the arrears and 
decided to refund fifty per cent. of them and forfeit 
the rest. The validity of this acquisition has to be 
decided independently of 
the 
acquisition 
of the 
estates. 
It has no connection with land reform 
or 
with' any 
public purpose. 
It stands on the same 
footing as other debts due to zamindars or their other 
movable properties, which it was not the object of 
the 
Act to acquire. 
As already stated, the only purpose 
to support this acquisition is to raise revenue to pay 
compensation to some of the zamindars whose 
estates 
are being taken. 
This purpose does not fall within 
any definition, however wide, of the 
phrase 
"public 
purpose" and the law therefore to this extent is un-
constitutional. 
One or two illustrations of the public purpose in-
volved in this provision will bring O\lt its true character. 
In Appeal No. 299 of 1951, the arrears of Darbhanga 
Raj 
011 
26th 
September, 
1950, 
was 
a sum of 
Rs. 30,81,967. 
Half of 
this 
amount is 
payable 
to 
the Raj and the other half stands forfeited. In the 
case of Raja P. C. Lal (Appeal No. 330 of 1951), 
the 
rents due were Rs. 10,26,103, and in Appeal No. 339 
of 1951, the amount is Rs. 9,52,937. 
Next it was contended that the impugned Act is a 
fraud on the Cunstitution and therefore void. 
It was 
said that the Act, while pretending to comply with 
the Constitution, evades and invades it ; that the Act 
merely pretends to comply with the Constitution when 
it says that it provides for payment of compensation 
but in effect it has produced a scheme for non-payment 
of compensation by shift and contrivance. 
Reference 
was made to certain provisions of the Act of a con-
fiscatory nature, already 
noticed 
in 
this 
judgment. 
Section 9 was mentioned under which mines in the 
-course of development and fetching no income yet 
' -

vest in the State without payment of compensation. 
No compensation has been made payable in respect of 
forests or trees which were not fetching 
any 
income 
at the date of vesting. 
In a nutshell, it was contended 
that the object of the Act was to acquire properties of 
the zemindars by payment of compensation (so-called) 
out of the moneys belonging to the 
zemindars 
them-
selves and that in some cases they had not only to 
give up their estates for nothing but would have to 
pay something, in addition, to the State, if the prin-
ciples specified in the Act 
were 
to 
apply. 
It was 
pointed out in the case of the Maharaja of Darbhanga 
that his zemindari would be acquired by 
the 
State 
Government without 
paying anythiµg 
but 
that the 
Maharaja would have to pay out of his own money 
six lakhs to the Government. 
In Case No. 330 of 
1951 (Raja P. C. Lall), it was said that 
Government 
would get the zemindari free, while in Case No. 339 of 
1951 the State will get the zemindari and two and half 
lakhs out of the arrears, while in Case No. 331 of 1951 
(Chota Nagpur appe;:il) the zemindari will be acquired 
on payment of a small sum of Rs. 14,000 only. 
No-
thing will be payable to the zamindars out of the 
public exchequer. 
Attention was drawn to the obser-
vations of Shearer J. in the following passage :-
"The legislature, it is clear, are optimistic enough 
to hope that this reform may conceivably be 
effected 
without raising any great loan. The conclusion, 
to 
my mind, is irresistible that the intention is to take 
over the great estates in the province, paying no com-
pensation or the most inadequate compensation, and 
out of the considerable profits which are likely to be 
derived from them, to take over, in course of time, the 
remaining estates 
and tenures. 
In other words, a 
comparatively small minority belonging to this parti-
cular class are to be expropriated without compensa-
tion or with the most inadequate compensation in 
order that, when the great majorit} 
are expropriated, 
they 
receive compensation which will 
not be in-
adequate and may, quite possibly, in many cases, be 
more than adequate."

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
[1952J 
Mr. 
Das 
vehemently contended that the statute 
was a fraud on republican Constitution which promised 
to deprive no one of his property without payment of 
compensation ; 
that it pretended to make elaborate 
provisions for paying it but that by shift and con-
trivance it has provided for the evasion of its pay-
ment. Reference was made to a passage 
in 
Moran 
Proprietary Ltd. v. Dy. Commissioner of Taxation for 
New Sottth Wales ('),which is in these terms:-
"Cases may 
be imagined 
in which a purported 
exercise of the power to grant 
financial 
assistance 
under section 96 would be merely · colourable. 
Under 
the guise or pretence of assisting a State with money, 
the real substance 
and 
purpose 
of the Act might 
simply 
be 
to 
effect 
discrimination in regard 
to 
taxation. 
Such an Act might well be 11/tra vires the 
Commonwealth 
Parliament. 
Their 
Lordships 
are 
using the language of caution because such a case may 
never arise, and also because it is their usual practice 
in a case dealing with constitutional matters to decide 
no more than their duty requires. 
They 
will add 
only that, in the view they take of the matter, some 
of the legislative expedient-objected to as ttltra vires 
by 
Evatt 
J. in his forcible dissenting 
judgment-
may_ well be colourable, and such acts are not receiving 
the approval of their Lordships." 
It was urged that a statute could be declared to be 
a fraud on the Constitution on the same principles 
that are applicable 
to 
cases 
of 
corporations or of 
executive bodies, whether they act in excess 
or 
in 
abuse of their statutory powers. 
Reliance was placed 
in this connction on the observations of 
Abbott C.J. 
in Fox v. Bishop of Chester("), which are 
in these 
terms:-
"Our judgment is founded upon the language of the 
Statute 31 Eliz. c. 6 and the well-known principle of 
law, that the provisions of an Act of Parliament shall 
not be evaded by shift or contrivance."

In Fox v. Bishop of Chester(1), it was said that there 
may be fraU<i on the law, an insult to an Act of Parlia-
ment, though in the language and text of the law no 
such fraud may have been mentioned. 
In Westminster 
Corporation v. London & North Western Raz'lway(2), it 
was observed :-
"It is well settled that a public body invested with 
statutory powers such as those conferred upon the 
corporation must take care not to exceed or abuse its 
powers. It must keep within the limits of the author-
ity committed to it. 
It must act in good faith. And 
it must act reasonably. The last proposition is involv-
ed in the second, if not in the first." 
In Maharaja Luchmeswar Singh v. Chairman of the 
Darbhanga Municipality(8), it 
was 
pointed out that 
the offer and acceptance of one rupee was a colourable 
attempt to obtain a title under the Land Acquisition 
Act without 
paying 
for the land. lq Alexander v. 
Brame( 4 ), it was observed that i£ it had appeared that 
sufficient ground existed · for holding that the deed in 
question was a device on the part of Mr. Brame for 
the purpose of evading and eluding the statute, by 
keeping seemingly and colourably clear of it, while 
meaning substantially to infringe it, 
a view might 
have been taken favourable to the appellants. 
All these principles are wellcsettled. But the ques-
tion is whether they have any application to the present 
case. 
It is by no means easy to impute a dishonest 
motive to the legislature of a State 
and hold that it 
acted mala fide and maliciously in passing the Bihar 
Land Reforms Act or that it perpetrated a fraud on 
the Constitution by enacting this law. It may be that 
some of the provisions of the Act may operate harshly 
on certain persons or a few of the zamindars and may 
be bad if they are in excess of the 
legislative 
power 
of the Bihar Legislature but from 
that 
circumstance 
it does not follow that the whole enactment is a fraud 
on the Constitution.

without payment of compensation, one 
cannot 
j~mp 
to the conclusion that the whole of the enactment ts a 
fraud on the Constitution or that all the provisions as to 
payment of compensation are illusory. 
At best 
they 
are illusory only in the case of some only of the large 
body of persons affected by it. 
Section 23(f), however, in my opinion, is a colour-
able piece of legislation. 
It has been enacted 
under 
power conferred by legislative entry 42 of 
List III. 
It is well-settled that Parliament with limited powers 
cannot do indirectly what it cannot do directly. (Vide 
South Australia v. The Commonwealth(') and Madden 
v. Nelson & P<>rt Sheppard R. W. Co.(2). In Deputy 
Federal Commissioner of Taxation (N. S. W.) v. W.R. 
Moran 
Proprietary Ltd. (8), it 
was 
observed 
as 
follows:-
"Where the law-making authority is of a limited 
or qualified character, obviously 
it may 
be 
necessary 
to examine with some strictness the substance of the 
legislation for the purpose of determ'ining what it is 
that the legislature is really doing. In such cases the 
court is not to be over persuaded by the appearance 
of the challenged legislation ........ In that case, this 
court applied the well known principle that in relation 
to constitutional 
prohibitions 
binding 
a 
legislature, 
that 
legi.~lature. cannot disobey the prohibition merely 
by employing an indirect method of achieving exactly 
the same result ........ The same issue may be whether 
legislation whieh at first sight appears to conform to 
constitutional requirlements is co~ble or disguised. 
In such cases the 
court may have to look behind 
names, form and appearances to 
determine 
whether 
or not the legislation is colourable or disguised." 
The provision 
herein 
impeached 
has 
not 
been 
arrived at by laying down any principles of payh;g 
compensation bur in truth, is designed to deprive a 
number of people of their property without 
payment 
of compensation. 
The State legislature is 
authorised 
to pass an Act in the interests of persons deprived of

propeny under entry 42. They could not be permitted 
under that power to pass a law that operates to the 
detriment of those persons and the object of which 
provision is to deprive them of the right of 
compen-
sation to a certain extent. 
In this connection it is no~ convenient to examine 
the contention of the learned Attorney-General as 
to 
the interpretation 
of 
legislative 
head 
entry 42 of 
List III. 
He contended that under this head it was 
open to the Parliament or the State Legislature to make 
a law laying down the principles which may result in 
non-payment of compensation or which may result in 
not paying any compensation whatsoever. 
I cannot 
possibly assent to any such construction of this entry. 
The entry reads tfius:-
"Principles on which compensation for 
property 
acquired or requisitioned for purposes of the Union or 
of a State or for any other public 
purpose is to be 
determined, and the form and manner in which such 
compensation is to be given." 
This head of legislation seems to have been expressly 
mentioned in the Concurrent List not only in view of 
the accepted principle of law that in cases of compul-
sory acquisition of property compensation has to be 
made but also in view of the clear and mandatory 
provisions of article 31(2) which require that a law 
authorising the taking or acquisition of propeny will 
be void if it does not provide for payment of compen-
sation for the property acquired or does not either fix 
the amount of compensation or specify the principles 
on which and the manner in which the compensation 
is to be determined and given. 
The power of legisla-
tion in entry 42 is for enacting the principles of deter-
mining such compensation and for 
paying it. 
The 
principles to be enacted 
are for 
determining 
such 
compensation 
and 
for paying 
it. 
The 
principles 
to be enacted 
are 
for determining the equivalent 
price of the property taken away. 
It may 
be that 
the 
determination of the 
equivalent 
may be left 
for ascertainment on the basis of certain uniform rul('s;

for instance, it may be laid down that the principles 
for determining compensation will be the rental basis or 
the market value of the property etc. 
But it is difficult 
to imagine that there can be any principles fur 
non-
payment of compensation or for negativing the 
pay-
ment of compensation. 
No principles are required to 
be stated for non-payment of compensation. A simple 
statement that no compensation will be paid is quite 
enough to attain the object. I know of no principles __ ior 
determination of compensation which result in its non-
payment except in the Act under notice. 
AlCfcgiS: 
lative heads have to be reasonably construed and the 
power given under entry 42 is a positive power given· 
to bring about the resuit of payment of compensation 
and not non-payment of the same. 
The 
key 
words 
in the entry are "compensation" and "given". Any-
thing that is no.related to compensation or the giving 
of it cannot be justified by legislation under 
entry 42, 
Reference was made in this connection to the United 
Provinces v. Atiqa Begum('), in which it was held that 
the 
descriptive 
words 
under 
the 
legislative 
head 
- "collection of rents" are wide .enough to permit k~-
lation in respect of remission ·of rents and that under 
item 22 of the Government of India Act, 
1935, 
the 
legislative head "forests" include the power to 
legis-
late with respect not only to afforestation but also to 
disafforestation and that the legislative head "fisheries" 
would include the power to legislate on the prohibi-
tion of 
fishing 
altogether. 
In 
my opinion, these 
analogies have no application . to the 
construction of 
the language employed in entry 42, These entries are 
not in par[ materia to 
entry 
42. Perhaps 
a 
more 
analogous case on the point is the decision in Attorney-
General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for t!te Domi-
nion ( 2). The question there 
was whether the legis-
lative head 
"Regulation 
of 
Trade and 
Commerce" 
included the power to abolish it also.

An entry concerning payment of compensation in no•v ornlOthera. ~­
sense includes legislative power of non-payment of\ 
compensation, The whole purpose of this head of/ MohajanJ. 
legislation is to provide payment of compensati_on andi 
-not the confiscation of property. 
· 
. -
· 
The provision that four per cent. to twelve and a 
half per cent. has to be deducted out of thenet income 
on account of costs of works for the benefit of raiyats 
etc. has no relation to real facts. Even the earlier 
provision in clause (d) that costs of management have 
to be deducted up to twenty per cent. has in its entirety 
no real relation to actual state of affairs. As already 
pointed out, it is partially of a confiscatory character 
in sufficient number of cases. The deduction under 
clause (f) from the gross income is merely a deduction 
of an artificial character, the -whole objecLbeing.. to 
inflate the deductions and thusJ1r.ing_about_11on,pay-
ment of compens_aJ;ion. -such legislation, in my 
op1mon, is not permitted by entry 42 of List III. 
Suppose, for instance, instead of a twelve and a half 
per cent. it declared that a deduction of seventy per 
cent. be made on that account. Could it be said by 
any reasonable person that such a piece of legislation (ti 
was legislation on principles of determining compensa- D 
tion or of making payment of compensation. This 
provision, therefore, in my opinion has been inserted 
in the Act as a colourable exercise of legislative power 
under entry 42 and is unconstitutional on that ground. 
The power has not been exercised -under any -- other 
legislative head authorizing the State legislature to 
pass such a law. Legislation ostensibly under one or 
other of the powers conferred by the Constitution but 
jn truth and fact not falling within the content of thai

power is merely colourably constitutional but is really 
not so. 
[Vide Quebec v. 
Queen Insurance Co. (') ; 
Russell v. The Queen(').] Reference in this connection 
may also be made to the decision of the Privy Council 
in Madden v. Nelson & Fort Sheppard R. W. Co. ('). 
This clause therefore is unconstitutional 
legislation 
made colourable valid under exercise of 
legislative 
power under entry 42 of List II. 
It was contended by Mr. Das that if some provisions 
in the Act are ultra vires, the statute as a whole must 
be pronounced to be ultra vires and that it could not 
be presumed that the legislature intended to pass it in 
what may prove to be a truncated form. 
The real 
quc:stion to decide in all such cases is whether what 
reamins is so inextricably bound up 
with 
the 
part 
declared invalid that what remains 
canno~ independ-
ently 
survive, 
or, 
as it 
has sometimes been put, 
whether on a fair review of the whole matter it can be 
assumed that the legislature would have 
enacted at 
all that which survives without enacting the 
part that 
is ultra vires. 
Look[ng at the Act 
as a whole, it 
seems to me that the offending provisions of the Act are 
not so inextricably bound up with the part that is 
valid as to hit or kill the remainder also. In this case 
a presumption cannot be drawn 
that the legislature 
would not have enacted the Act leaving out the two 
or three provisions which have to be declared to be 
invalid. 
Mr. Das also raised a 
Act was unenforceable. 
section 32(2) of the Act 
minor point that the Bihar 
Reference 
was 
made 
to 
which runs as follows :-
"The amount of compensation so payable in terms 
of a compensation Assessment-roll as finally published 
shall be paid in cash or in bonds or partly in cash and 
partly in bonds. 
The bonds shall be either negotiable 
or non-negotiable and non-transferable and be payable 
in forty equal instalments to the person named the1ein 
and shall carry interest at two and a half per centum 
per annum with effect from the date of issue."

It was contended that as no date has been ment_ion-
ed for payment of compensation and no interval has 
been stated between the instalments mentioned therein 
and it has not been 
mentioned how much would be 
payable in cash and how much in bonds, the Act could 
not be enforced. 
Section 43 of the Act empowers the 
State Government to make rules for carrying out the 
purposes of the Act. Clause (p) is in these terms :-
"The proportion in which compensation shall 
be 
payable in cash and in bonds and the manner of pay. 
ment of such compensation under sub-sections (2) and 
(3) of section 32." 
It seems clear that the Act has made sufficient provi-
sion for enforcing its provisions if section 32(2) is read 
with the provisions contained in section 43 
and it 
cannot be said that the Act is unenforceable for this 
reasi;.>n. 
The last point urged by M. Das was that section 32 
(2) of the Act was void as in it legislative functions 
had been abdicated by the legislature in favour of the 
executive. 
A two-fold attack was levelled against this 
prov1S1on. 
Firstly, it was 
said that the Constitution 
having _in entry 42 of List III of the Seventh Schedule 
vested authority in the legislature to make laws on 
the question of the principles as to the payment of 
compensation and the manner and form of its payment, 
in other words, it h;, ving trusted these matters to 
the 
care, judgment and wisdom of the legislature, it had 
no power to delegate these matters to the executive. 
Secondly, it was contended 
that 
section 32 (2) dele-
gated essential legislative power to the executive which 
it was incompetent to do. Reference was made to the 
opinion of this court in Special Reference No. 1 of 
1950. 
The matters alleged to have been delegated are 
these:-
1. The determination of the proportion of the cash 
payment to the payment by giving bonds, 
negotiable 
' ' 
or non-negotiable.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
[1952} 
2. The determination of the period of 
redemption 
of the<e bonds. 
3. The period of interval between the several instal-
ments. 
The section enacts that 
the compensation payable 
shall be paid in cash or in bonds or partly in cash and 
partly in bonds. It therefore determines the 
principle 
that the payment of compensation will be in these two 
forms. It further enacts that bonds shall be either 
negotiable or non-negotiable and 
non-transferable. It 
therefore also determines the nature 
of 
the 
bonds 
that would be 
issued. 
It further 
enacts that the 
payment, if made in bonds, will be paid in forty 
equal instalments. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
the 
time 
of redemption of 
the 
bonds 
will be co-terminous 
with the period of the 
instalments. It has further 
enacted that the bonds will carry interest at the rate 
of two and a half per cent. 
What has been left to 
the executive is the question of the determination of 
proportion in which compensation is to be paid in 
cash or in bonds and the fixation of the interval of the 
instalments. It seems to me that the delegation to this 
extent is permissible in view of the decision of this 
Court in The State of Bombay v. 
Narottamdas fetha-
bai (') and the decision of their Lordships of the Privy 
Council in Queen v. Burah(2). 
The legislature applied 
its mind to the question of the method and manner of 
payment of compensation. 
It settled its 
policy and 
the broad principles. 
It gave the 
State 
Government 
the power to determine matters of detail after having 
settled vital matters of policy. 
It cannot be said that 
the legislature did not apply its mind to the subject-
matter of the legislation and did not lay down a policy. 
The proportion in which compensation was payable in 
cash or in bonds or whether the whole of it was to be 
paid in cash is a matter which only the State Govern-
ment could fix and similarly, 
the interval of instal-
ments and the period of redeemability of 
the bonds 
were also matters of detail which the; · executive could

.more oppositely determine in exercise of its rule-mak-
mg power. 
It cannot be said in this case 
that any 
essential legislative power has been delegated to 
the 
executive or th.at the legislature did not discharge the 
trust which the Constitution had reposed in it. If the 
rule-making authority abuses its power or makes any 
attempt to make the payment illusory, the 
expropriat-
ed proprietor will not be without a remedy. 
For the reasons given above, I am of the opinion 
that section 32(2) of the Act cannot be held bad on the 
ground that it is a piece of 
unregulated delegation of 
legislative power. 
Mr. Das's contention in Cases 
Nos. 319, 327, 330 
and 332 of 1951 and in the other cases in which he 
appeared were the same. 
Mr. Chaudhury appearing in Cases Nos. 309 and 328 
of 1951 raised a large number of points, some of which 
are covered by the arguments of Mr. P. R. Das, which 
I have 
discussed 
already. 
The rest seem to me to 
be unsubstantial but it is necessary to notice a few 
of them upon which 
great 
stress 
was 
laid by the 
learned counsel. 
Mr. Choudhury contended that the 
field of legislation on the question of principles of 
determination of compensation 
and 
the 
mode 
and 
manner of payment of such compensation was already 
occupied by the Land Acquisition Act which was an 
existing law of Parliament and, 
t~refore, the State 
Legislature could not enter on this field and legislate 
on the principles of payment of compensation. This 
argument really has no force, because the provisions 
as to a~sessment of compensation enacted in the Land 
Acquisition Act 
only 
apply to 
acquisitions that are 
made by notification under that Act. 
Its provisions 
have no application to acquisitions made under either 
local or central laws unless they are specifically made 
.applicable by the provisions of these statutes. 
·Another point put forward by 
him, that 
articles 
31-A and 31-B 
of 
the 
Constitution 
cannot affect 
pending cases cannot be seriously entertained because 
retrospectivity is writ large

the face

articles. 
Similarly, 
I 
cannot but regard 
as un-
substantial 
his 
contention 
that 
transference 
of 
estates of zamindars to the State under the provisions 
of a statute requires registration. 
The only other 
point 
seriously pressed 
by 
him 
iis 
that the Bihar 
Legislature had 
no power to issue bonds 
without 
complying with the procedure laid down in article 293 
of the Constitution. 
It is enough to state with regard 
to this poiint that the stage for issuing bonds 
has 
not 
arrived as yet. 
When 
the 
State 
legislature 
issues 
bonds which 
are 
unenforceable or which it is not 
competent to issue, the 
contention can 
possibly be 
raised. 
Mr. Chakravarty who appeared m 
three cases, 
Noo. 326, 337, and 344 of 1951, urged that as regards 
trust properties, the 
Bihar legislature had no power 
to acquire them without payment of full 
compensa-
tion as certain educational and 
charitable institutions 
would thereby be seriously affected. He was, however, 
unable to point out how the Bihar Legislature had no 
power to acquire trust properties. 
Mr. Raghav Saran who appeared in Cases Nos. 310, 
311 and 329 of 1951, raised a novel point that the 
Act 
not being reasonable 
and just, the Supreme 
Coun ·had jurisdiction 
to declare it void 
on that 
ground. He was unable 
to support his argument 
on any 
reasonable 
basis. 
The 
constitutionality of 
a statute 
passed by 
a 
competent legislature cannot 
be challenged on the ground that the law 
made 
is 
not reasonable or just. 
Counsel who appeared in Cases Nos. 307, 313, 315, 
320, 321, 322 and 331 and 
Petition No. 612 of 1951 
merely adopted the points urged by Mr. P. R. Das. 
f 
The result is that the provisions o f the Bihar Land 
Reforms Act contained in sections 4(~) and 23(f) are 
held not constitutional. The rest of the Act is good. 
The appeals are therefore allowed except to the extent 
indicated above. 
A writ of mandamus will issue 
to 
the State Government not to give effect to the two 
\ 
provisions mentioned above and held 
unconstitutional.

There

and petition. 
MuKHERJEA J.-1 had the advantage of going care-
fully through 
the judgment of my learned brother 
Mahajan J. and I concur entirely in the 
conclusions 
arrived at by him. 
In my opinion, the Bihar Land 
Reforms Act of 1950 is not unconstitutional, with the 
exception of the provisions contained 
in section 4(b) 
and 23(f) of the Act and these provisions alone must 
be held to be void and inoperative. 
As regards section 23(f) the Bihar Land Reforms 
Act, my learned brother has based his decision on the 
ground that the provision of this clause constitutes a 
fraud on the Constitution, and although 
in enacting 
the provision, 
the 
legislature 
purported 
to 
exer-
cise 
its 
powers 
under entry 
42 
of 
the 
Legisla-
tive List III 
in Schedule VII of the 
Constitution, 
in reality i:t is a colourable 
exercise of that 
power 
under 
which 
a 
thing has 
been 
done wliich is 
not contempleted by 
that entry at all and 
lies 
outside its ambit. 
I agree with the line of reasoning 
adopted by my 
learned brother 
in 
this 
connection 
and there is nothing further which 
I can usefully 
add. 
As regards section 4 (b) it has been held by my 
learned brother that the provision of this clause is un-
constitutional as it does not disclose any public pur-
pose at all. 
The requirement of public purpose . is 
implicit ~ compulsory 
acquisition 
of 
property by 
the State or, what is called, the exercise of its power 
of eminent domain. This condition is implied in the 
provision of :irticle 31 (2) 
of the 
Constitution and 
although the enactment in the 
present 
case 
fulfills 
the requirements of 
clause (3) of article 31 and as

[1952] 
such attracts the operation 
of 
clause 
(4) 
of 
that 
article, my 
learned brother 
has takien the view that 
the bar created ·by cleause ( 4) is confined to the ques-
tion of compensation only and does not extend to the 
existence or 
necessity of 
a 
public 
purpose which, 
though implicit in, 
has 
not been expressly provided 
for by clause (2) of the article. 
For my part I would 
be prepared to assume that clause ( 4) of article 31 
relates to everything that is provided for in clause (2) 
either in express terms or even 
impliedly 
and con-
sequently tl1e question of the 
existence of a public 
purpose does 
not come within 
the purview 
of our 
enquiry in the present case. Even then I would hold 
that the same reasons, which have weighed with my 
learned 
brother 
in 
declaring section 23(f) 
of the 
impugned 
Act to 
be unconstitutional, 
apply 
with 
equal, if not greater, force to section 4 (b) of the Act 
and I have no hesitation in agreeing with him as 
regards his decision on 
the 
constitutionality 
of 
this 
provision of the Act though I would prefer to adopt 
a different line of reasoning in support of the same. 
Section 4 (b) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act lays 
down, as one of the results of the 
publication 
of a 
notification under section 3(1) of 
tl1e 
Act that "all 
arrears of rents........ and all cesses 
together 
with 
interest, if any, 
due 
thereon for any period prior to 
the date of vesting which were recoverable in respect 
of the estate or tenure by the proprietor or tenure-
holder and the recovery of which was not barred by 
any law of limitation shall vest in and be recoverable 
by the 
State". 
The 
explanation 
attached 
to 
the 
clause 
further 
provides 
that 
for purposes of the 
clause the expre"ion "arrears of rent" 
shall include 
arrears in 
respect 
of 
which 
suits were 
pending 
on 
the 
date 
of 
vesting 
or in respect of which 
decrees were obtained before that date together with 
costs allowed 
by 
such decrees. 
Under 
section 24 
of the Act, 50" lo of these arrears of rent are directed 
to be added 
to 
the amount of 
compensation money 
payable for the estate or interest calculated in accord-
JP 
ance with the provisions of the Act.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS

The arrears of rent whether merged in decrees or 
not, whic.h were due to the landlord for a period ante-
rior to the date of notification under section 3(1) of the 
Act, were 
undoubtedly the property of the landlord, 
irrespective of his interest in the estate or tenure which 
is the subject-matter of acquisition. Such arrears could 
not vest in the State as a normal result of acquisition 
of 
any 
estate 
or 
interest 
therein, 
and it 
is 
con..:cdcd by the learned Attorney-General that article 
31-A of the Constitution has no application so far as 
these arrears of rent are concerned. The arrears of rent, 
therefore, are the subject-matter of separate and indi-
pendent acquisition i1nrler the Rih:i.r 
I,,~nd Reforms 
Act, if the word "acquisition" can at a11 be appropriate 
to cases of this description. 
It cannot be disputed that in every Government 
there 
is 
inherent 
authority 
to 
appropriate 
the 
property of the citizens for 
the 
necessities 
of the 
Statt: and constitutional provisions do not confer 
this 
power though they generally surround it with safe-
guards. 
The restrains invariably are that when pri-
vate property is taken, a pecuniary compensation must 
be paidC1 ). 
Thus eminent domain is an attribute of 
sovereign power supposed to be tempered by a princi-
ple of natural law which connects its exercise with a 
duty of compensation(2). 
Possibly under the impression that the sacredness of 
private property should not be confided 
to 
the un-
certain virtues of the party in power for 
the 
time 
being, the Constitution-makers of 
our 
country 
have 
declared it as one of the fundamental rights 
that no 
property shall be taken possession of or acquired for 
public purpose unless the law directing its appropriation 
makes provision for compensation in the manner 
laid 
down in article 31 ( 2). Clause ( 4) of article 31 does not 
do away with the obligation to pay compensation ; it 
merely lays down that laws which are referred to in 
clause (3) of the article would be immune from judi-
cial 
scrutiny on the ground of inadequacy of the

amount of compensation or the impropriety 
of 
the 
principle for assessing the same as provided for in the 
enactment. 
The clause presupposes however 
that the 
enactment is the result of a valid exercise of a legis· 
lative power 
conferred 
on 
the legislature by 
the 
appropriate entries in the Legislative Lists and if the 
legislature acts outside these entries or, under the pre-
tence of acting within them, does something which is 
in flat contradiction with its contents, clause ( 4) of 
article 31 could not be invoked to afford any protec-
tion to such legislation. 
Clause ( 4) (b) of the impugned Act read with the 
provision of section 24 of the same, 
empowers 
the 
State Government to appropriate all the arrears of 
rent due to a landlord at a particular time and the 
only obligation it casts on the Government in this 
respect is to allow 50"/o of the amount thus appro-
priated as sol'lllium for the so-called acquisition. On 
the face 
of 
it 
the legislative provision purports 
to 
have been made in exercise of the powers conferred on 
the 
State 
legislature under entry 36 of List II and 
entry 42 of List III of Schedule, VII of the Constitu-
tion. 
In my opinion, this is a mere device or pretence 
and the real object which the 
legislation intended 
to 
accomplish is to deprive a man of his money which is 
not ordinarily a subject-matter of acquisition, in exer-
cise of what are known as powers of eminent domain 
by the State, 
without giving him anything 
in 
ex-
change; and under the guise of acting under entry 42 
of List III, the legislature has in truth and substance 
evaded and nullified its provisions altogether. 
The general p_rinciples, which distinguish the powers 
of eminent domain from other powers 
of the State 
under which the sacrifice of the proprietary interest 
of a citizen could be demanded or imposed, are fairly 
well-known. 
As has been observed by Cooley in his 
Constitutional 
Limitations 
"every 
species 
of pro-
perty which the 
public 
needs may 
require 
and 
which the 
Government 
cannot lawfully 
appropriate 
under any other right, is 
subject to be seized and

~ppropriated under the right of eminent domain('). 
Money as such and also rights in action arc ordinarily 
excluded from this List by American jurists and for 
good reasons(2). There could be no possible necessity for 
taking either of them under the power 
of 
eminent 
domain. Money in the hands of a citizen can be 
reached 
by the exercise of the power of 
taxation, it 
may be confiscated as a penalty under judicial order 
and we can even conceive of cases where the State seizes 
-or confiscates money belonging to or in the hand~ of a 
citizen under the exercise of its 'police' powers on the 
ground that such fund may be used for unlawful pur-
poses to the detriment of the interest of the community. 
But, as Cooley has pointed out(3), taking money under 
the right 
of eminent domain when it must be 
eompc"'ated by money afterwards could 
be 
nothing 
mor-e or less than a forced loan and it is difficult to 
say Stat it comes under the head of acquisition or re-
quisitioning of property as described !n entry 36 of 
List II and is embraced within its ordinary connot-
ation. 
It is said by the learned Attorney-General that the 
subject matter of acquisition in the present case is not 
money but choses in action. It seems to me that there 
is no difference in principle between them because a 
-chose in action can 
be 
available to the acquiring 
authority only when it is made to produce money ; 
Otherwise it is useless altogether(3). 
Assuming however that entry 36 of List II is wide 
enough to include acquisition of money or a right of 
action, I have no hesitation in holding that in Qr~vid­
ing for compensation in respect of such acquisition the 
legislature has made a colourable use 
of entry 4:l oi 
List III and has thereby defeated the purpose of that 
entry altogether. 
Entry 42 of List 
III 
speaks of 
"principles 
on 
which 
compensation 
for 
property 
acquired or requisitioned for the purposes of the Union 
or of a State or any other public purpose is to be

determined, and the form and the manner m which 
such compensation is to be given". 
This is a descrip-
tion of legislative head and I agree with the learned 
Attorney-General that in deciding the competency of the 
legislation under this entry, we are not concerned with 
the justice or propriety of the principles upon which the 
assessment of compensation is to be made under a parti-
cular legislation nor are we concerned with the justice· 
or otherwise of the form or manner in which such 
compensation is to be given. 
I 
do 
not, however, 
agree 
with 
the 
learned Attorney-General 
for 
the 
reasons already given by my learned brother in 
his 
judgment that legislation under this head need not pro-
vide for any compensation at all and that a legislative 
provision which declares that no compensation is to be 
given comes within the ambit of this legislative head. 
Such construction is repelled by the very language of 
the entry which speaks 
of 
giving compensation and 
not of denying or witholding it. 
Stripped of all dis-
guise, the net result of the impugned provision is that 
it would be open to the State Government to appro-
priate to itself half of the arrears of rent 
due to the 
landlord prior to the date of the acquisition without 
giving him any compensation whatsoever. 
Taking of 
the whole and returning a half means nothing more or 
less than . taking half without any return and this is 
naked confiscation, no matter in whatever specious 
form it may be clothed or disguised. 
The impugned 
provision, therefore, in reality does not lay down any 
· • 
principle for determining the compensation to be paid 
for acquiring the arrears of rent, nor does it say any-_ 
thing relating to the form of payment, though appar-
ently it purports to 
determine 
both. 
This, in my 
opinion, is a fraud on the Constitution and makes the 
legislation, which is a colourable one, void and 
in-
operative. 
The 
learned Attorney-General 
has 
con-
tended that it is beyond the compentency of the Court 
to enter into a question of bona fides or mala fides of 
the legislature. 
In a sense this is true. If the legis-
lature is omnipotent, tl:;i.e mqtives, which impel it to 
enact a particular law, are absolutely irrelevant; 
arid 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS

on the other hand, if it lacks competence the question 
of motives does not at all arise. 
But when a legis-
latU.re has a limited or qualified power and has got to 
act within a 
sphere 
circumscribed 
by 
legislative 
entries, the question, whether in 
purporting 
to act 
under these entries, it has, in substance, gone beyond 
them and has done certain things 
which 
cannot 
be 
accomplished within the scope of these entries, is really 
a question affecting the competency of the legislature. 
In such cases, although the legislation purports to have 
been enacted under a particular entry, if it is really 
outside it, it would be void(1). It has been suggested 
in course of the argument on behalf of the State that 
in the present case the Government in the exercise of 
its powers of acquisition could acquire the arrears 
of 
rent and as the arrears were still unrealised, it was 
quite legitimate and proper for the 
Government 
to 
deduct half of the gross amount as consideration for 
the trouble and expense that it would have to undergo 
in the matter of realising these arrears. 
This would 
mean that what the legislature intended is simply to 
enable the Government to 
help 
the 
zamindars in 
realising the arrears' of rent and as a return for the help 
which it is to render, the Government is given the 
right to retain half of the arrears that were actually 
due. 
This could not possibly have been the real in-
tention of the legislature and I do not think that there 
is any item in the long legislative lists framed by the 
Constitution which empowers the legislature to inter-
fere with the legal rights of the landlord in this manner 
apart from special circumstances like indebtedness or 
otherwise and impose upon him an onerous obligation 
to which he is not a consenting party. A legislation of 
this character is a complete novelty, the like 0£ which 
has seldom been witnessed before. 
The result is that 
I concur in the order which 
has 
been 
made by my 
learned brother Mahajan J. in this case and I allow 
the appeals subject to the two modifications 
indicated 
above. There would be no order as to costs.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
[1952] 
DAs J.-The proceedings out of which these appeals 
have arisen were initiated by different proprietors of 
estates in Bihar challenging the constitutional validity 
of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 (Bihar Act XXX 
of 1950) 
which will hereafter in this judgment be 
referred to as "The Act". 
On January 26, 1950, when our Constitution came in-
to force, the Bill which eventually became the Act was 
pending before the Legislature of the State of Bihar. 
After the Bill had been passed 
by 
the State Legis-
lature, it was reserved for the consideration of the 
President. 
On September 11, 1950, that Bill received the 
assent of the President and became the Act. The provi-
sions of the Act have been analysed and summai;ised in 
the judgment just delivered by Mahajan J. and it is 
not necessary for me to burden 
this 
judgment 
by 
recapitulating 
the same. 
On 
September 
25, 
1950, 
the text of the Act 
was published 
in 
the Official 
Gazette with a notification under section 1 (3) dated 
September 24, 1950, bringing the Act into operation. 
A notification under 
section 3 
of 
the Act 
dated 
September 25, 
1950 
vesting · the 
estates of certain 
named proprietors 
was 
published in · the 
Official 
Gazette on the next day. 
This 
Notification 
having 
been published in the Official Gazette, some of the 
proprietors 
affected 
thereby 
instituted 
suits 
in the 
Subordinate Courts in Bihar after giving the requ1S1te 
notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
and prayed for a declaration that the Act was uncon-
stitutional and void and that their title to the pro-
perties remained 
unaffected. 
Some 
of 
the 
other 
proprietors filed applications in the High 
Court 
at 
Patna under article 226 of the 
Constitution 
praying 
for the issue of appropriate writs, directions or orders. 
The State of Bihar filed its written statements in the· 
suits which were transferred to the High Court for 
disposal in exercise of its extraordinary Original Civil 
Jurisdiction. 
The suits 
and 
the 
applications were 
heard together. 
As the issues involved grave ques-
tions of intcroretation of the Constitution, the suits 
and applications were placed before a Special Bench 
' 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
965 
of the Patna High Court and were disposed 
of 
on 
March 12, 1951. 
All the 
learned 
Judges, 
for 
one 
reason or another, repelled all the main contentions 
of the proprietors but held that the Act was uncon-
stitutional in that it. denied to the 
proprietors 
equal 
protection of the laws guaranteed 
by 
article 14 
of 
the Constitution. 
The High· Court rejected 
the 
plea 
of the State that article 31 ( 4) of the Constitution by 
reason 
of 
the 
words "notwithstanding anything in 
this Constitution" excluded article 14 at least 
in its 
application to the alleged inequality of compensation. 
Article 31(4) is in these terms:-
"lf any Bill pending at the commencement of this 
Constitution in the Legislature of a State has, after it 
has been passed by such Legislature, been reserved for 
the consideration of the President and has received 
his 
assent, 
then, 
notwithstanding 
anything in this 
Constitution, the law 
so assented to shall 
not be 
called in question in 
any 
court 
on the 
ground 
that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2)." 
. The State of Bihar obtained leave of the Patna 
High Court under article 132 (1) of the Constitution 
to appeal to this Court and preferred these appeals 
before us. 
It may be mentioned here that the States of Uttar 
Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh also 
passed 
legislation 
for the abolition of zamindaries 
in their respective 
States and the validity of those legislations 
was also 
contested by the 
proprietors 
affected thereby. 
The 
respective High Courts of those States, however, 
up-
held the validity of the respective 
State 
legislations 
and the aggrieved proprietors came up to this Court 
either on appeal or on substantive application 
under 
article 32. 
It was at that stage that the 
Constituent 
Assembly passed the Constitution (First 
Amendment) 
Act, 1951. 
Sections 4 and 5 of the Act which 
are 
material for our purpose are as follows :-

A new Schedule called the Ninth Schedule specifying 
thirteen several Acts and Regulations 
of which 
the 
Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, 
was 
the first was 
added to the Constitution. 
The legal validity of the 
Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, has 
been 
recently upheld by this Court and all Courts 
must 
give effect to the two 
new articles which are now 
rubstantive parts of our 
Constitution. 
Article 
31-A 
relates back to the 
date of the Constitution and 
article 31-B to the respective dates of the Acts and 
Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule. 
It 
has 
not been disputed that the provisions of the above 
two newly added articles have to be taken into con-
sideration in disposing of these appeals. 
Learned counsel appearing for 
the 
respondents 
accept 
the position that as a result of the 
con-
stitutional 
amendments 
tl1e 
impugned 
Act 
has 
been removed from the operation of the provisions 
of Part III of the Constitution including 
article 14 
and that the respondents cannot, 
therefore, 
complain 
of the breach of the equal protection of the laws under 
arcicle 14 which was the only ground on which the 
respondents succeeded 
in the High Court. 
Learned 
counsel, however, maintain that although they 
cannot 
now challenge the constitutionality of the Act on 
the 
ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with 
or 
takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by 
any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution ; 
it is, nevertheless, open to them to call the Act into 
question on other grounds founded on other parts of 
the Constitution or on 
general 
principles 
of 
law. 
Accordingly Mr. P. R. Das formulates 
the following 
five principal 
grounds 
of attack against the 
Act, 
namely: 
A. On a proper interpretation of articles

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
[1952] 
List III the Bihar Legislature had no power to enact 
the said Act inasmuch as it makes no provision for the 
payment of just compensation . for the proposed acqui-
sition of the zamindaries and tenures. 
B. Even if the Court does not 
accept the correct-
ness of the arguments based on entry 36 in List II and 
entry 42 in List III and holds the respondents barred 
from going into the question of compensation by reason 
of articles 31(4), 31-A and 31-B 
the 
respondents are 
still entitled to challenge the Act on the ground that 
the proposed acquisition is not for a public purpose. 
C. The Act constitutes a fraud on the Constitution, 
tllat is to say, while it purports to be in conformity 
with the Constitution it, in fact, constitutes a definance 
of it. 
D. The Act is unenforceable 111 
that section 32(2) 
provides for payment of 
compensation 
in 
40 equal 
instalments' without specifying the period 
of 
interval 
between the instalments. 
E. The Act delegated essential legislative 
functions 
to the executive Government. 
The heads of 
objections 
Mr. P. R. Das apparently look

the arguments advanced by him 
of them. 
thus 
formulated 
by 
formidable and 
it 
1s 
with 
close attention 
in support 
of 
each 
Re Ground A : That article 31 (2) imposes upon a 
law for the compulsory 
acquisition of private pro-
perty the obligation to provide for compensation 
and 
that such obligation is, therefore, 
a 
provision of 
article 31(2) is not challenged. 
Nor is it claimed, in 
view of articles 31( 4), 31-A and 31-B, that it is 
still 
open to the respondents to call in question the valid-
ity of the impugned Act 
on 
the 
ground 
that it 
contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes 
away or 
abridges the provision 
for 
compensation 
made in 
article 31(2). What is urged 
is 
that the obligation 
to provide for compensation is not a provision 
to be 
found exclusively in article 31(2) but that it is also 
provided for in other parts of the 
Constitution 
and 
.. 
-
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
969 
that, in so far as such obligation is found provided 
elsewhere, the impugi:ed Act can well 
be 
challenged 
on the ground that it contravenes or 
is inconsistent 
with or takes away or abridges the provisions of those 
other parts 
of the 
Constitution, for that ground 
of 
challenge has not been taken away by articles 31 ( 4), 
31-A and 31-B, by reason of the delimiting words used 
therein. 
The argument is developed in the following 
way. The State's power to acquire private 
property 
is, in essence, a power to compel the owner to sell his 
property when the public interest requires it. 
Autho-
rity for this: proposition is to be found in Blackstone's 
Commentary (Broom's Edn.) p. 165 and in 
Cooley's 
C,onstitutional Limitations, 8th Edn., Vol. II, 
p. 1201, 
Footnote (3). 
Indeed, In some of the English statutes 
for compulsory acquisition of lands and 
hereditaments 
(e.g. 5 & 6 Vic. C. 94 and 8 & 9 Vic. C. 18) the word 
"purchase" was used to denote acquisition. 
As there 
can be no sale without a price, there can be no com-
pulsory acquisition of private property without a pro-
vision for 
payment of just compensation, i.e., 
its 
equivalent value in money. That the obligation to 
pay just compensation 
for 
compulsory acquisition of 
private property is a principle of natural 
equity 
re-
cognised by all temperate 
and 
civilized governments, 
that the right to compensation is an incident to 
the 
exercise of the power of eminent domain and that 
the 
one is so inseparably connected 
with the other that 
they may be siaid to exist, not as separate and distinct 
principles but, as parts of one and the same principle 
are well-established by a series 
of 
decisions 
of 
the 
American courts quoted by Harlan J. in Chicago, Bur-
linghton and Quincy. Railroad Company v. Chicago(1). 
In England Lord Dunedian in Attorney-General v. 
De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd.(2), described the obli-
gation to pay 
compensation 
as 
"a 
necessary 
con-
comitant to taking". 
It follows, therefore, 
that 
the 
obligation to pay compensation 
is 
inseparable 
from 
and is implicit in the power of acquisition. This obli-

[1952] 
gation flows ftom the mere use of the word "acquisi-
tion" in entry 36 in List II, as in entry 33 in List I. 
That word, by itself, according to Mr. P. R. Das, con-
notes a compound concept, namely, the concept of a 
power of taking on just terms and confines the very 
legislative competency under those entries 
within 
the 
limits of that compound concept. 
If, however, the 
word "acquisition" in entry 36 in List II and entry 
33 in List I does not by itself imply the obligation to 
pay just compensation, then, urges Mr. P. R. Das in 
the alternative, the words "subject to the provisions 
of entry 42 of List III" occurring at the end of entry 
36 in List II certainly brings in that obligation. 
On 
a plain reading of entry 36 in List II 
the power to 
make law with respect to matters specified therein is 
"subject to", that is to say, 
"conditional 
upon" 
the 
exercise of legislative power under entry 42 in List III. 
Those conclud~ng words\ Mr. P. R. Das says, import 
the obligation to provide for compensation as provided 
in entry 42 in List III into entry 36 in 
I)st II 
and 
thereby enlarge the 
content 
of 
the 
last mentioned 
· entry so as to make it a 
legislative head comprising 
\he compound concept referred to above. 
The third 
alternative position is that if the 
word "acquisition" 
in entry 36 in List II does not, by itself, imply the 
obligation to provide 
for 
compensation 
and 
if 
the 
words. "subject 
to the 
provisions 
of 
entry 42 
of 
List !Ii" do not import that obligation 
as stated 
above, entry 42 in List III 
should, 
nevertheles~, be 
construed as conferring a power coupled with a duty, 
so that if the law-making power under entry 33 in 
List I or entry 36 in List II is at all exercised, the law-
making power under entry 42 in List III must, on the 
principle 
laid down by 
the 
House 
of 
Lords 
in 
/ulus v. 
Lord Bishop of 
Oxford(') and adopted 
by this Court 
in 
Chief Controlling Revenue Autho-
rity v. Maharashtra Sugar Mills Ltd.('), also be exer-
cised. 
It is urged 
that the

purported to exercise its power to make a law 
for 
compulsory acquisition of property under entry

List II but not having made any law laying down any 
principle for determining what may, in the eye of the 
law, be regarded as just compensation at all, the Act 
is ultra vires and 
void. 
The arguments thus deve-
loped by Mr. P. R. Das undoubtedly have the merit 
of 
attractive ingenuity 
and 
apparent cogency 
and 
certainly call for very careful consideration. 
To cut at the root of the above argument the learned 
Attorney-General appearing 
for 
the 
appellant 
State 
contends that the impugned Act is a law made with 
respect to matters mentioned in entry 18 in List II and 
not under entry 36 in List II. The contention is that 
it is essentially 
a 
leg~slation for land reforms and 
alteration of land tenures. It is pointed out that the 
Act eliminates the interests of all zernindars and in-
termediate tenure-holders so that the State and the 
actual tiller of the soil may be brought into direct 
relationship. 
Incidental to this 
primary object is the 
acquisition of the various interests in the land. 
Re-
ference is made to the cases of The United Province; 
v. Mst. Atiqa Begum and Others('), Thakur /agannath 
Baksh Singh v. The United Provinces(2) and Megh Raj 
-and Another v. Allah Rakhia and Others(8) in support 
of the proposition that each entry in the list, which is 
a category or head of the subject-matter of legislation, 
must be construed as widely as possible so as 
to in-
clude all ancillary matters. 
This lien 
of reasoning 
found favour with Shearer J. 
but was rejected by 
Reuben J. and S. K. Das J. 
There is no doubt that 
"land" in entry 18 in List II has been construed in 
a 
very wide way but if "land" or "land tenures" in that 
entry is held to cover acquisition of 
land also, then 
entry 36 in List II will have to be held as 
wholly 
redundant, so far as acquisition of land is concerned, a 
conclusion to which I am not prepared to assent. 
In 
my opinion, to give a meaning and content to each of 
the two legislative heads under entry Ht and entry 36 
in List II the former should be read as a legislative

category or head comprising land and land tenures and 
all matters connected therewith other than acquisition 
of land which should be read as covered by entry 36 
in List II. 
Further, the impugned Act purports to 
acquire all arrears of rent and a 
la~ for acquisition of 
the arrears of rent cannot possibly be said to be a 
law with respect 
to 
matters specified 
in entry 
18 
in List II for it cannot be supposed 
to be a law 
relating to the collection of rent within the meaning 
of that entry. 
On this point I find myself in agree-
ment with Reuben J. and S. K. Das J. and I cannot 
accept the arguments of the learned Attorney-General 
to the contrary. Therefore, the arguments of Mr. P. R. 
Das founded on entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in 
List III cannot be rejected in limine but have to be 
considered and I proceed to do so immediately. -
That the obligation to pay compensation is con-
comitant to, that is to say, accompanies, the power of 
compulsory taking of private property 
by 
the State 
cannot be disputed. The first 
important question 
is 
whether this obligati'on is implicit in the term "acquisi-
tion" as used in entry 36 in List II, or in other words 
whether this obligation is to be inferred simply from 
the nse of that term as a part of the content or mean-
ing thereof. 
In Attorney-General v. De Keyser's Royal 
Hotel Limited (supra) Lord Dunedin pointed out that 
the power of acquisition was, in its origin, derived 
from the prerogative of the Crown and that the pay-
ment of compensation was 
originally 
a matter 
of 
negotiation and bargain between the Crown and the 
subject, but came to be determined later on by statutes 
of local application and finally by statutes of general 
application and that, therefore, the Crown, 
which is 
an assenting party to every statute, must, in effect, be 
regarded as having consented 
to the exercise of its 
prerogative being made subject to payment of compen-
sation regulated by statutes. 
In 
that 
case, however, 
it was not disputed in 
arguments 
that the 
taking 
itself was a 
matter 
of 
prerogative right. 
In the 
United States 
of 
America the 
power 
of 
eminent 
domain was not originally, 
in terms, conferred on 
• 
.. 
-
•

S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS

the United States by any provision of the Federal 
Constitution, but this power has always been recog-
nised to 
exist 
as 
an inherent 
attribute 
of 
the 
sovereignty of the State. 
So far as the United States 
are concerned, the 
Fifth Amendment by providing 
that private property shall not be taken for public use 
without just compensation gave a constitutional recog-
nition to the right of eminent domain and, to protect 
the subjects, imposed a limitation on the exercise of that 
right by the State. 
This indicates 
that the power of 
acquisition and the 
obligation 
to pay compensation 
are two separate and 
distinct concepts 
although the 
second follows the first. If the obligation to pay com-
pensation were an integral part of the concept or the 
meaning of "taking" itself, then this part of the Fifth 
Amendment 
was 
wholly 
unnecessary. 
It 
follows, 
therefore, that the expression "acquisition" does 
not, 
by itself and without more, 
import any obligation to 
pay ·compensation. 
It is urged 
by 
Mr. 
P. R. Das 
that entry 
42 in List III really implements the obli-
gation implicit in entry 36 in 
List II and 
the 
two 
entries are complementary to each other. If this obli-
gation were not implicit in entry 36 in List II 
then 
where else, 
it 
is asked, 
is the obligation to pay 
compensation to be found ? The obvious answer 
is 
that that obligation is to be found in article 31(2) in 
. Part III 
of 
our 
Constitution. 
The 
obligation 
to 
pay compensation may be introduced as a· part of the 
legislative power itself, in which case it 
becomes 
a 
composite 
power, namely, a power to make law with 
respect to acqui.sition circumscribed by the· obligation 
to provide for compensation. 
Thus 
in 
section 
31 
(XXXI) of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitu-
tion Act the acquisition of property on just terms has 
been made a head or category of legislative power of 
the Commonwealth 
Parliament. 
There the power is 
not to make a law for the acquisition of property sim-
pliciter but is to make a law for the acquisition 
of 
property on just terms which connotes that the legis-
lative power itself is circumscribed by the necessity 
for providing just terms. But there is 
no 
overriding

[1952] 
necessity of constitutional law that I know of, or that 
has been brought to our notice, which 
requires 
that 
the obligation to pay compensation for the acquisition 
of property must be made part and parcel of the very 
legislative power to make a law with respect 
to 
the 
compulsory acquisition of private property. 
It 
must 
depend on the provisions of the particular constitution 
under consideration. 
What do we find in our Con-
stitution ? We find that under article 246 Parliament 
has exclusive power to make laws with respect, inter 
ulia, to matters specified in entry 33 in List I, namely, 
"acquisition or requisitioning of property for the pur-
poses of the Union, that the State 
Legislatures 
have 
exclusive power 
to make laws 
with respect, inter 
alia, to matters specified in entry 36 in List II, namely, 
the "acquisition or requisitioning of property except 
for the purposes of the Union subject to the provision 
of entry 42 of List III" and that both Parliament and 
the State Legislatures may make laws with respect to 
matters set forth in entry 42 in List III, namely, the 
principles for determining the compensation and 
the 
form and manner of giving such compensation. 
This 
legislative power of Parliament or of the State Legis-
latures is, by article 245, made "subject to the provi-
sions of this Constitution." 
One of the provil;ions 0f 
the Constitution is article 31 (2) under which no pro-
perty can be "taken 
possession of or acquired for 
public purposes under any law authorising the taking 
of such possession or such acquisition unless the law 
provides for compensation for the property and either 
fixes the amount of 
compensation 
or 
specifies the 
principles on which, and the mam:1er in which, the 
compensation is to be determined and given." 
The 
scheme of our Constitution obviously is to provide the 
three things separately, namely, the power of making a 
law for acquisition of property in article 
246 read 
with entry 33 in List I and entry 36 in List II, the 
obligation of such law to provide for compensation in 
article 31 (2) and the power of making a law laying 
down the · principles 
for 
determining such compen-
sation in article 246 read with entry 42 in List III.

According to this scheme it is not necessary at all 
to regard entry 33 in List I and entry 36 in List II, 
which are mere heads of legislative power, as contain-
ing within themselves any obligafion to provide for the 
payment of compensation. 
In other words, it is not 
necessary to treat the obligation to pay compensation 
as implicit in or as a part or parcel of these legislative 
heads themselves, for it is 
separately and expressly 
provided 
for 
in 
article 
31 (2). 
The 
well-known 
maxim expressum f acit 
cessare tacit um 
is, 
indeed, 
a principle of logic and common sense and not 
merely a technical rule of construction (See Broom's 
Legal Maxims, 10th Edn., p. 443 at p. 452). The 
express provision in article 31 (2) 
that a law of 
acquisition, in order to be valid, must provide for 
compensation, will, therefore, necessarily exclude all 
suggestion 
of 
an 
implied obligation to provide for 
compensation sought to be impo.i;.ted into the meaning 
of the word "acquisition" in entry 36 in List II. 
In the face of the express provision of article 31 (2) 
there remains no room £or reading any such impli-
cation in the legislative heads. 
Mr. P. R. Das suggests, in the alternative, that if 
the obligation to provide for compensation is not 
implicit in the word "acquisition" itself as used in 
entry 36 in List II that obligation is 
a~tracted and 
made a part and pared of that entry by reason of 
the words "subject to the provisions of entry 42 of 
List III". 
The last mentioned words are, however, 
not to be found l.n entry 33 in List I and this pan of 
Mr. P. R. Das's argument would lead to this anomal-
ous result that while the obligation to provide for 
compensation is made a part of the legislative power 
under entry 36 in List II by virtue of its last few 
words quoted above, no such obligation is attractedt 
and made part of the legislative power under entry 33 
in List I, and that, therefore, in making a law with 
respect to acquisition of property under entry 33 in 
List I Parliament, unlike the State Legislatures, will 
not be bound to provide for any compensation at all. 
This cannot possibly be the intention of the framers

of our Constitution. 
Further, Mr. P. R. Das reads 
the words "subject to" as meaning "conditional upon" 
the exercise of the legislative power under entry 42 in 
List III, that is to say, conditional upon fulfilling the 
obligation to provide for compensation and the form 
and the manner in which such compensation is to be 
given. 
I agree with S. K. Das J. that 
the~ words 
"subject to" have not the meaning sought to be given 
uo them by Mr. P. R. Das but that they mean "but 
not" so as to indicate that the scope of entry 36 in 
List II is restricted, that is to say, that the subject-
matter of entry 42 in List III is not within the content 
of entry 36 in List II. 
If entry 42 in List III were, 
by reason of the words "subject to the provisions of 
entry 42 of List III" occurring in -entry 36 in List II, 
to be read as having been made a part of the content 
of entry 36 in List II then it may well be argued 
that, in view of article 246, . Parliament will not 
be competent 
to 
maintain 
law 
with 
respect 
to 
principles on wh'ich 
compensation is 
to be deter-
mined. 
It is 
in order to prevent this 
argument 
and 
out of 
aqundant 
caution 
that - the 
subject-
matter of entry 42 in List III has been excluded 
from the content 
of entry 36. in List II by the words 
"subject to" et cetera and Parliament may, therefore, 
freely make a law with respect to the matters thus 
excluded from entry 36 in List II and set forth as a 
separate and independent item in entry 42 'in List III. 
This consideration was not material in connection with 
entry 33 in List I which explains the omission of the 
words "subject to" et cetera from that entry. 
Mr. P. R. Das finally urges that if the obligation to 
provide for compensation is not implicit in the word 
"acquisition" in entry 36 in List II and if that obliga-
tion is not to be read into that entry even in view of 
the words "subject to .............. " at the end of it, 
even then if the State exercises its power to make a 
law with respect to 
acquisition 
of 
property 
under 
entry 36 in List II it is the duty of the State Legisla-
ture to make a law also with respect to matJters speci-
fied in entry 42 in List III on the principles that as 
• 
. ..., 
• 
• 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
977 
entry 42 in List III confers a power on the Legisla-
ture for the protection of the interest of persons; whose 
property is compulsunly acquired, such power must, 
therefore, be regarded as coupled with a duty to exer-
cise it. No authority has been brought to our notice 
establishing or even suggesting that the principle laid 
·dawn by the House of Lords in Julius v. Lord Bishop 
of Oxford (supra) has been extended to the exercise of 
Legislative power and I am not prepared to assent to 
the proposition. 
Article 246 does not make it obli-
gatory for Parliament or the State Legislatures to 
make a law under any of the entries in any of the 
Lists in the Seventh . Schedule. 
Entry 42 in List III 
does not, therefore, impo~e any duty upon Parliament 
or the State Legislatures to make any law for payment 
of compensation. What requires Parliament or State 
Legislatures, 
when 
making . a 
law for compulsory 
acquisition of private property, to provide for com-
pensation and either to fix the amount thereof or 
specify the principles on which and the manner in 
which the compensation is to be determined and given 
is the provision of art'icle 31 (2). Entry 42 in List III 
only constitutes a legislative head under which Parlia-
ment or the State Legislatures may make a law so as 
to give effect to the obligation expressly imposed 
on 
them by article 31 (2). In view of the clear provision 
of that article it is wholly unnecessary to read entry 
42 in List III as imposing an implied duty on the 
Legislature on the principle referred to in the Hoose 
of Lords case. 
That the obligation to provide for compensation is 
not included in the content of the legislative power 
u_nder entry 36 in List II, by itself or read with entry 
42 in List III, will be made further clear when we come 
to consider closely clauses (4) and (5) of article 31 and 
article 31-A. Article 31 ( 4) protects a law of the descrip-
tion mentioned therein 
against 
the 
provisions. 
of 
article 31 (2). It follows, therefore, that what is sought 
to be protected by article 31 (4) is a law for the acqui-
sition or taking possession of property which does not, 
amongst other things, pro-ifide for compensation or

does not fix the amount or specify the principles on 
which and the manner in which the compensation is 
to be determined and given, for otherwise there would 
be no necessity for any protection. 
The question 
at 
once arises as to whether there is any legislative entry 
in List II under which a law for acquisition or taking 
possession of property without compensation can be 
made by a State Legislature. 
To test the validity of 
Mr. P. R. Das' s argument and to avoid the complica-
tion arising out of the residuary powers of Parliament 
under article 248 and entry 97 of List II I have taken 
the case of a law otf acquisition made by the legislatures 
of a State which also come within article 31(4). Is 
there, then, any entry in List II under which a State 
Legislature can make a law for acquisition without 
compensation or pub!'ic purpose ? Obviously there is 
none, except entry 36 in List II. If that entry by it-
self or read with entry 42 in List III has any impli-
cation as suggested, namely, that a law for acquisition 
of property made under entry 36 in List II without a 
provision for compensation 
wiJll be beyond the legis-
lative 
compentency 
of the 
State \Legislatures, then 
there is no other entry under which such a law can be 
made 
by a State Legislature and there can, therefore, 
be no point in making a prOIVision in article 31(4) for 
protecting, against article 31(2), a law which, on this 
hypothesis, cannot be made at all. Article 31(4) postu-
lates a law which offends against 31(2) and so far as the 
State Legislatures are concerned there is no entry in 
List II except entry 36 under which such an offending 
law may made by the State Legislatures. This cir-
cumstance unmiistakabRy 
establishes thait entry 36 in 
List II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List III, ha.s 
not any such implication as is imputed to it. Likewise . 
tak:e article 31(5) (b) (ii) which protects the provi-
sions of any law which the State may hereafter make 
for the promotion of public health or the prevention 
of danger to life or property. The law wh'ich is thus 
sought 
to be protected must also involved acquisition 
of property without any provision. for · compe~sation, 
for otherwise there can be no occas10n or necessity for 
• 
"· 
• 
-
• 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
979 
any protection against article 31 (2). 
A law of this 
kind, in so far as such law provides for acquisition of 
property, must necessarily be made by a State Legis-
lature, if at all, under entry 36 in List II. If Mr . 
P. R. Das's contentions were correct, a law for the 
promotion of health or the prevention of danger to 
life or property involving the acquisition of property 
without a provision for compensation, which is what 
is sought to be protected from article 31 (2), can never 
be made, for the obligation to provide for compensa-
tion is, according to him, implicit 'in entry 36 in 
List II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List III, and 
there is no other entry under which a law may be 
made by a State Legislature with respect to acquisi-
f1on of property. 
It is futile to attempt to get over 
this anomaly by suggesting that clauses ( 4) and (5) (b) 
(ii) of article 31 have been inserted in the Constitution 
ex abundanti cautela, for, if Mr. P. R. Das were correct 
in his submission, no amount of caution was necessary 
for protecting a law that, ex hypothesi, cannot be made 
at all. Similar arguments may as well be founded on 
article 31-A, for that article also protects a law from 
article 31 (2) which is in Part III of the Constitution. 
It is - suggested that article 31-A postulates a valid 
law made by 
a competent legislature within the 
ambit of its legislative powers. If a State Legislature 
in making a law for the acquisition of property for a 
public purpose under entry 36 in List II must pro-
vide for compensation then a law made conformably 
with this supposed requirement of that entry by a 
State Legislature will require no protection ar all 
agalnst article 31 (2), and article 31-A must be regard-
ed 
as 
meaningless 
and 
unnecessary. 
Surely, that 
conclusion is manifestly untenable. 
In my opinion 
clauses ( 4) and (5) (b) (ii) of article 31 and article 31-A 
clearly negative Mr. P. R. Das's proposition. 
In my 
judgment, for the reasons stated above, the major 
premise in the arguments advanced by Mr. P. R. Das 
under the first head, namely, that the obligation to 
pay compensation is implicit in entry 36 in List II by 
itself or read wiith entry 42 in list III is unsound.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
[1952] 
The obligation to provide for compensation being, as 
I hold, a provision of article 31 (2) and not being im-
plicit m or a part and parcel of the legislative power 
itself under entry 36 in List II read by itself or in 
conjunction with entry 42 in List III, the impugned 
Act cannot, by virtue of article 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B, 
be called in question on the ground that it contravenes 
or is 'inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any 
of the rights conferred by the provisions of clause (2) 
of 
a~ 'de 31, that is to say, that it does not provide 
for compensation. 
Assuming that the obligation to pay compensation 
which is expressly provided in article 31 (2) ·is also 
implicit in entry 36 in List II by itself or read with 
entry 42 in List III the respo!ldents cannot, even 
then, be permitted to call in question the validity of 
the impugned Act on the ground that it does not pro-
vide for compensation, for then they will be doing 
exactly what they are forbidden to do by article 31 
(4) and the newly added articles. Article 31 (4) and the 
added articles debar the respondents from questioning 
the validity of the Act on the ground, inter alia, that 
it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or 
abridges any of the rights conferred by the provisions 
of clause (2) of article 31. The emphasis in those 
articles is rather on the "provisions" than on the 
number of the article or the Part of the Constitution. 
It is obvious that the real substance of the matter is 
that articles 31(4), 31-A and 31-B expressly seek to 
prevent a challenge to the validity of the Act based 
on the ground, inter alia, that it does not provide for 
compensation. 
TIJils obliganbn to provide for compen-
sation is no doubt one of the provisions of articles 31 
(2) but if, as contended by Mr. P. R. Das, the 
self same provision be found elsewhere in the same 
Constitution, e.g., entry 36 in List II or entry 42 in 
List III, then that "prorvision" must also be regarded 
as having been covered by article 31 ( 4) and the two 
added articles, for otherwise those articles will be ren· 
dered nugatory. 
In my opinion, if two construc-
tions are possible, the Court should adopt that· which 
• 
.. 
• 
• 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
981 
will implement and discard that which will stultify 
the apparent intention of the makers of the Con-
stitution. 
Further, it must be borne in mind that 
article 
31 ( 4) 
which applies "notwithstanding any-
thing in this Constitution'', will, by force of the very 
words, protect the Act against everi legislative in-
competency, if any arising out of the alleged non-
compliance with the suggested implied provisions, if 
any, of entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in List III. 
In my judgment the respondents are not, by reason of 
articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B, entitled to call the Act 
in question on the ground that it does not provide for 
compensation, whether the ground ~s formulated as a 
breach of article 31 (2) or of the implied provision, if 
any,. of the legislative heads mentioned above. 
It will be noticed that the argument that the .Act 
is unconstitutional is founded on the assumption that 
it has not laid down any principle for determining 
compensation as required by entry 42 in List III and 
that the provision for compensation is wholly illusory. 
Chapter V of the Act deals with assessment of compen-
sation. 
Shortly put, the scheme is to start with the 
gross assets which are taken to be synonymous with 
the gross income and then to make certain deductions 
therefrom and to arrive at the net assets. 
Then the 
compensation is to be calculated at a sliding scale 0£ 
rates varying from 20 to 3 times of the net income. 
To the amount thus determined is to be added a moiety 
of the accumulated arrears of rent etc. and the com-
pensation for the mines and minerals as determined 
under section 25. 
Ex f acie, it cannot be disputed that 
the Act does prescribe some principles for determin-
ing the compensation payable to the proprietor c.r 
tenure-holder. 
It is, however, pointed out that the 
deduction of 5 to 20 per cent. of the gross assets as 
and by way of cost of management is quite arbitrary. 
It is said that although it is well known that the per-
centage of cost of management in relation to the 
income of a small estate is greater than that of a 
larger estate, yet the Act provides for deducting 20 per-
cent. of the gross assets in the case of proprietors

of the larger estates but only 5 per cent. in the 
case of the smaller estates. 
Objection is next taken 
to the deduction of any amount under the head of 
works of benefit to raiyats the and also to the scale 
of such deduction. These arguments, to my minct, 
do not, on close scrutiny, amount to saying tha:: 
the Act does not lay down any principle for determin-
ing the compensation. The real underlying implica· 
tion of these arguments, as I understand them, is that 
the principles are not good enough in that they do .not 
produce fair compensation. 
I do not think the Court 
can go into the policy of the legislation. All that the 
Court is concerned with is to see whether any principle 
has been laid down as mentioned in entry 42 in List III. 
It is true that the percentage of costs of management 
calculated on the basis of the income of a big estate is 
less than that of a smaller estate, but it is quite clear 
that the Act has fixed the scale of deducion under 
this head and under the head of works of benefit 
according to the capacity of the proprietor or tenure-
holder to bear it. It is impossible to say that the 
provision for deduction for works of benefit to the 
raiyats is not supported by any principle. 
A landlord 
.is expected to spend money on works of benefit to his 
raiyats, 
e.g., 
providing tanks 
and wells, 
irrigation, 
charitable dispensary, schools and so forth and be it 
said to the credit of some of the landlords that in 
practice they do spend money on this account. There-
fore, there is nothing wrong, when calculating the net 
income of a landlord, to deduct something which the 
landlords should and some of them often do, in prac-
tice, spend under this head. 
I see 
no 
absence of 
principle in this provision. The rate of deduction, I 
have said, has been fixed according to the capacity 
of the proprietors or tenure holdens. 
It 
has 
been 
shown, and it is not denied that in many cases a 
calculation of the net income on the basis of the 
principles laid down in in the Act operates to reduce 
the gross income to a very small net income. To take 
only one instance, the gross annual income of the 
barbhanga estate is about Rs. 47,85,069, the deduction

allowed by the Act is about Rs. 44,88,585, and the 
net income computed according to the principles laid 
down in the Act comes to about Rs. 2,96,484 or say 
Rs. 
3 · lacs 
and the compensation payable 
to 
the 
Maharajadhiraj of Darbhanga will 
be 
only rupees 
9 lacs. It has also been shown that at least in one case, 
e.g., iu the case of the Raja of Purnea the compensation 
calculated according to the principle laid down in the 
Act works out at a deficit figure. The fact that in one 
isolated case the calculation may work out in thi~ way, 
does not, however, prove that no principle has been 
laid down. Indeed, in all other cases the principle laid 
down 
in the 
Act 
actually 
produces 
compensation, 
however inadequate it may be said to be in some 
cases. 
If a principle has been laid down, then the pro-
visions of entry 42 in List III are amply satisfied and 
no question of legislative incompetency can arise. 
If 
a principle has beeh laid down in the Act but that 
principle does not in fact produce any compensation 
in any rare case or adequate compensation in some 
cases then the real complaint should be, not that no 
principle has been laid down but, that the principle 
laid down does not produce what may be called just 
compensation. 
That result may offend 
aga·1nst the 
provisions of article 31 (2) but certainly not against 
entry 42 in List III and in view of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A 
and 31-B the Act cannot be challenged for non-com-
pliance with article 31 (2). On the other hand, even 
if i;t is held that no principle has, in fact, been laid 
down by the Act, as contended, then that 
fact 
not 
only amounts to a breach of the provisions of entry 42 
in List III but also constitues a breach of the provi-
sions of article 31 (2) which clearly and emphatically re-
quires the law to either fix the compensation or lay 
down the principles on which and the manner in 
which the compensation· is to be given and a breach 
of this "provision", call it a provision of article 31 (2) 
or one of entry 42 in List III, cannot, for reasons 
already stated be questioned in view of articles 31 ( 4), 
31-A and 31-B. 
It should also be remembered that

anything

this 
Constitution" 
occurring 
therein 
will also protect the Act even 
against 
the alleged 
legislative incompetency 
arising 
out 
of 
the 
non-
compliance with all provisions of the Constitution 
relating to the payment of compensation or the exist-
ence of a public purpose including the supposed re-
quirement of producing actual compensation said to 
be implicit in the provisions of entry 42 in List III. 
In my judgment, the Act cannot be called in question 
on the ground of legislative incompetence of the Bihar 
Legislature to enact it under entry 36 in List II or 
entry 42 in List III. 
What I have stated above is sufficient to repel the 
first ground of attack levelled against the Act by 
Mr. P. R. Das. 
But before passing on to the second 
main ground of attack I think it right to deal with a 
few subsidiary points canvassed before us. 
It is said that section 3 of the Act, which is its main 
operative section, does not contemplate 
or authorise 
the acquisition of arrears of rent at all, for the notifi-
cation under that section only refers to the vesting of 
the estates or tenures in the State. 
It is, however, to 
be noticed that the consequeunce of issuing that notifi-
cation is that the arrears of rent including all that are 
mentioned in clause (b) of section 4 are also to vest in, 
and be recoverable by, the State. This vesting of the 
arrears of rent in the State necessarily 
implies 
the 
transfer of the rights of the proprietors or tenure-
holders to the State and this process must, therefore, 
amount to the acquisition of that right by the State, 
Therefore, in effect, the Act does contemplate the 
acquisition of the arrears of rent by the State. 
On the authority of a passage in Willis' Constitu-
tional Law, p. 816, it is argued that the power of 
eminent domain cannot be exercised with respect to 
money and choses in action besides certain other un-
usual forms of property. This passage is . founded on 
certain earlier decisions of the American Courts. It is, 
however, clear from 
Nichols

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
v. Louisville & 
N. R. Co.(1) cited therein that the 
modern view is that the right of eminent domain can 
be exercised on choses in action. In any case we are 
to consider whether arrears of rent are "property" in 
the sense m which that expression ts used in our 
Constitution and understood m our law. 
What are 
the arrears of rent but rents that have fallen due but 
have not been paid? It is not at all money in the till 
of the landlord but it is a debt due by the tenants. 
It 
is, therefore, nothing but an actionable claim against 
the tenants which is undoubtedly a species of "pro-
perty" which is assignable. 
Therefore, it can equally 
be acquired 
by the States as 
a species of "pro-
perty." 
It is finally urged that the Act makes no provision 
for payment of compensation for taking this item of 
property. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
in 
section 
24 
the 
word 
"compensation" 
is 
used 
m 
connection 
with the taking of the estates or 
tenures and also 
the taking of mines and minerals but not in con-
nection with the fifty per cent. of the arrears of 
rent which are directed to be added to the compen-
sation. 
But this prov1S1on for adding the fifty per 
cent. of the arrears also appears in the chapter headed 
"Assessment 
of 
Compensation" 
and, 
therefore, 
the 
fifty per cent. of the arrears ts added m the process 
of 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
compensation. 
Further, 
why is this: fifLY per cent. 
given to the proprietors or 
tenure-holders at all unless it were for compensation? 
It ts pointed out that when the State takes away a 
lac of· rupees and returns 50,000 rupees, it, in reality, 
pays no compensation but by this shift 
and 
contri-
vance only takes away thet other 50,000 rupees for 
nothing. 
This argument sounds plausible at first but 
is not founded on any good principle. This argument 
arises only because a moiety js paid back, as it were, 
m the same com. 
If compensation for money were 
made, say, by g1vmg some land of the value of a 
moiety of the money taken, the same argument would 
not have been available and all that could be said

i 
would have been that the land so given, 
not 
being 
equivalent in value to the money compulsorily taken 
away, 
could not be said to be a JUSt compensation. 
That argument, in view of articles 31(4), 31-A and 
31-B, would , of course, have been futile. 
But I see no 
difference in principle or law when compensation for 
acquisition of arrears is made in money. In 
such 
a 
case if only a moiety of the amount of 
arrears 
is 
returned the obvious complaint will be that the return 
of 50,000 rupees is not fair or adequate compensation 
for taking 
away 
Rs. 1,00,000 
and 
that 
complaint 
may have prevailed had there been no provision 
like 
those we 
have 
in 
articles 31(4), 31-A and 
31-B. 
Apart from this, the argument completely 
overlooks 
the fact that the arrears of rent are not really cash in 
the till of the proprietor or tenure-holder but is only a 
d~bt due by the tenants. What is 
the market value 
of this book debt ? This debt will have to be realised, 
possibly by suit followed by execution proceedings in-
volving time and money in costs. 
Part of it, 
quite 
conceivably, may not be realised at all. Therefore, the 
State takes the risk< of realising or not realising the 
arrears of rent but irrespective of the results of 
its 
efforts for their realisation the fifty per cent. of the 
arrears is in a lump added to the compensation. This, 
to my mind, indicates clearly that compensation is in 
fact paid for the arrears of rent and I am not prepared 
to say that the payment of a moiety of the book debts 
as compensation is so illusory as to amount to nothing, 
as contended by Mr. P. R. Das. Even if it be inadequate, 
the grievance will be not that no principle has been 
laid down in the Act as 
required by entry 42 in 
List III but, that the principle so laid down does not 
produce adequate compensation and there is, therefore, 
a contravention of the provisions of article 31(2). That 
defect cannot, however, _be 
made a ground of attack 
in view of articles 31(4), 31-A and 31-B for reasons ex-
plained above. 
• 
Re Ground B: The second point urged by Mr. P.R. 
'\ 
Das is that even if the Court does not accept the argu-
· . 
ment as to the necessity for providing for compensation

being implicit in entry 36 
in List II and 
entry 42 
in List III and holds that the respondents are, by 
reason of the provisions of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 
31-B, 
debarred 
from 
questioning the validity of the 
Act on the ground that it does not provide for compen-
s.i.tion 
the respondents are, nevertheless, entitled to 
challenge the Act on the ground of the absence of a 
public purpose. 
That the existence of a public pur-
pose is an essential prerequisite to the exercise of the 
power of compulsory acquisition has not been disputed 
by the learned Attorney-General. 
The contention put 
forward on behalf of the respondents is that the neces-
sity for the existence of a public purpose as a condi-
tion 
precedent to compulsory 
acquisition of private 
property is not a "provision" 0£ articl\! 31 (2) but is a 
requirement of entry 36 in List II or entry 42 in 
List III. 
The words "for public purposes" do occur 
in article 31 (2) but it is said that there is a distinction 
between a "provision" and an assumption. It is urged 
that article 31 (2) assumes a law authorising the taking 
of possession or the acquisition of property for a public 
purpose and provides that the property shall not be 
taken possession of or acquired even for that public 
purpose unless the law also 
provides for compensa-
tion. 
It is, therefore, concluded that the only "pro-
vision" 
of article 31 (2) is 
that 
the 
law 
autho-
rising the taking of possession or 
the acquisition 
of 
property 
for 
a public purpose 
must 
provide 
for 
compensation 
and 
it 
is 
this 
"provision" 
only 
that cannot 
be made 
a 
ground of attack 
on the 
Act by reason of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B of 
the Constitution. This argument has 
found favour 
with Reuben J. and S. K. Das J. 
The latter learned 
Judge; after referring to a passage in his own judg-
ment in the earlier case of Sir Kameswar Singh v. The 
Province of Bihar(1) concludes as follows :-
"Clause (2), strictly speaking, does not, in express 
words, make "public purposes" a condition precedent 
.to compulsory acquisition 
but rather 
assumes 
that 
such acquisition can be for public purposes only ; it 
<loes so by necessary implication."

The learned Judge then refers 
to the following 
passage in the judgment 
of 
my 
learned 
brother 
Mukherjea J. in Chiranjit Lal Choudhury v. The Union 
of India & Others(') :-
"Article 31 (2) of the Constitution prescribes a ·two-
fold limit within which such superior right of 
the 
State should . be exercised. 
One limitation imposed 
upon the acquisition of taking possession of private 
property which is implied in the clause is that such 
taking away must be for public purpose. 
The other 
condition is that no property can be taken unless the 
law which authorises such 
appropriation contains 
a 
provision for payment of compensation in the manner 
laid down in the clause." 
I do not, however, see how the above observations 
of Mukherjea J. in any way support the argument of 
Mr. P. R. Das that the existence of a public purpose is 
not a provision of article 31 (2) but is an inherent 
condition of any legislation for compulsory acquisition 
of private property. 
It is significant that Mukherjea J. 
recognises that article 31 (2) "prescribes" a two-fold 
limit. 
Surely, a Emit which is "prescribed" by 
the 
articles must be a provision · thereof. In any case, 
what 
is 
implied in the 
clause must, nevertheless, 
be 
a provision 
of the 
clause, for 
the 
expression 
"provision" 
is 
certainly 
wide 
enough 
to 
include 
an 
implied 
as 
well 
as an express 
prov.1S1on. 
Be 
that as it may, I am prepared to go further and say, 
fur reasons I shall presently explain, that the require-
ment of a public purpme as an essential prerequisite 
to compulsory acquisition is, if anything, essentially a 
provision of tha.t clause and an integral part of it. 
Article 31 is one of a group of articles included in 
Part III of tl1e Constitution under the heading "Funda-
mental Rights". 
It confers fundamental right in so 
far as it protects private property from State action. 
Ch use (1) of the article protects the owner from being 
deprived of his property save by authority of law. A 
close examination of the language of clause ( 1) will.

show that this immunity is a limited one and this will 
at once be clearly perceived if we convert the negative 
language of clause (1) into positive language. 
In its 
positive form clause (1) will read :-
"Any person may be deprived of his property by 
authority of law". 
The only limitation put upon the State action is the 
requirement that the authority of law is a prerequisite 
for the exercise of its power to deprive a person of his 
property. 
This confers some protection on the owner 
in that he will not be deprived of his property save by 
authority of law and this protection is the measure of 
the 
fundamental 
right. 
It is 
to 
emphasise this 
immunity from 
State action as a fundamental right 
that the clause has been worded in negative language. 
Likewise, clause (2) is worded 'm negative language in 
order to emphasise the fundamental right contained 
therein. 
The enunciation of this 
fundamental 
right 
necessarily 
requires a statement of the ambit and 
scope of the State action and to fix the 
ambit and 
scope of the State action it is necessary to specify the 
limitations on the State action, for that limitation 
alone 
i' 
the 
measure 
of the fundamental 
right. 
Clause (2) of the article, in its positive form, omitting 
words unnecessary for our present purpose, w
111l read 
as follows :-
"Any property, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . may 
be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes 
under any 
law 
auhorising 
the 
taking 
of 
such 
possession or such acquisition if the law provide for 
compensation for the property taken possession of or 
acquired ............ " 
Put in the above form, the clause makes it clear at 
once and beyond any shadow of doubt that there are 
three limitations imposed upon the power of the State, 
namely, (1) that the taking of possession or acquisition 
of property must be for a public purpose, (2) that such 
taking of possession or acquisition must be under a 
law authorising such taking of possession or acquisition 
and (3) that the law must provide for compensation

for the property so taken or acquired. 
These three 
limitations constitute the protection granted to the 
owner of the property and is the measure of his funda-
mental right under thi; clause. 
Unless these limita-
tions were provisions of the article, the article would 
have afforded no immunity at all. I am, therefore, 
clearly of opinion that the existence of a public pur-
pose as a prerequisite to the exercise of the power of 
compulsory acquisition 
is an 
essential 
and integral 
part of the "provisions" of clause (2). If the require-
ment of a public purpose were not a provision of 
article 31 (2), then it will obviously lead us to the un-
tenable conclusion that Parliament will be free under 
its residuary powers under article 248 and entry 97 of 
List I of the Seventh Schedule to make a law for ac-
quiring private property without any public purpose 
at all and to the still more absurd result that while 
Parliament will 
have 
to 
provide for 
compensation 
under article 31 (2) in a law made by it for acquisitio• 
of property for a public purpose it will not have to 
make any provision for compensation in a law made 
for acquisition of property to be made without a public 
purpose. 
Such could never have been the intention of 
the framers of our Constitution. The existence of a 
public purpose as a condition precedent to the exercise 
of the power of compulsory acquisition being then, as 
I hold, a "provision" of article 31 (2), an infringement 
of such a provision cannot, under articles 31 (4), 31-A 
and 31-B, be put forward as a ground for questioning 
the validity of the Act. 
Mr. P. R. Das's second line of argument on this 
main head is that the necessity for the existence of a 
public purpose is . implicit in entry 36 in List II and 
that the existence of a public purpose is also a re-
quirement of entry 42 in List III which is made a 
part of entry 36 in List II by virtue of the 
words 
"subject to" etc., appearing at the end of that entry 
and his conclusion is that in the absence of a public 
purpose the Bihar Legislature had no legislative com-
petency under those two entries to enact the impug-
ned Act and that this ground of attack, is still available

to ·him notwithstanding the 
provisions 
of 
articles 
31 (4), 31-A and 31-B. He does not rely on any other 
part of the Constitution as insisting on the existence 
of a public purpose as a prerequisite for compulsory 
acquisition of private property. 
Entry 36 covers any 
purpose except the purpose of the Union and is not, 
in 
terms, 
limited 
to 
public 
purpose. 
Secondly, 
the argument based on the words "subject to" etc. at 
the end of entry 36 in List II which are supposed to 
import the provisions of entry 42 in List III 
into 
entry 36 in List II is not well-founded and it becomes 
obvious when we look at entry 33 in List I. There 
are no words at the end of that entry as "subject to" 
etc. and, therefore, the alleged requirement of a public 
purpose under entry 42 in List III cannot be said to 
be incorporated in entry 33 in List I. It would, there-
fore, follow that whereas under entry 36 in List II 
which is to be read with entry 42 in List III by reason 
of the words "subject to" etc. in entry 36 in List II 
the Legislature of a State can only make a law for 
compulisory acquisition of property for a public pur-
pose, Parliament may, under entry 33 in Llst I which 
does not attract entry 42 in List III, make a law for 
compulsory acquisition of property without a 
public 
purpose. Such a result could never have been intend-
ed by the Constitution. 
Besides, turning to entry 42 
in List III, I find nothing in support of Mr. P. R. Das's 
contention. 
The words "acquired or requisitioned for 
the purposes of the Union or of a State or for any 
other public purpose" in that entry are merely words 
descriptive of the preceding word "property". The 
matters comprised in entry 42 in List III, as a legisla-
tive head, are the principles for the determination of 
compensation and the form and manner of giv'ing 
the 
compensation 
for 
property which is described 
as 
having 
been 
acquired· 
or 
requisitioned 
for 
the stated 
purposes. 
That 
entry 
cannot possibly 
be regarded as a legislative 
head 
for 
acquisition 
of property 
and 
much 
less is 
the 
purpose 
or 
province of that entry to lay down any requirement 
of a public purpose as a condition precedent for the

acqms1t10n of any property. 
In my opm10n entry 42 
in List III is of no assistance to Mr. P. R. Das for this 
part of his argument. 
Further, the reasons for which 
I have discarded his . arguments as to the obligation to 
provide for compensation being implied in entry 36 in 
List II by itself or read with entry 42 in List III will 
also apply to this contention mutatis mutandis and they 
need not be restated here. To put it shortly, the pro-
visions of article 31 (2) which, as I have explained, 
require the existence of a public purpose, will exclude 
the implication sought to be read 
into entry 36 in 
List II and entry 42 
111 
List III. Secondly, what 
articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B exclude is a challenge to 
the Act on the ground of contravention of the "pro-
vision" of clause (2). If the "provision" of clause (2) 
of article 31 as to the necessity for the existence of a 
public purpose as a prerequisite to compulsory acquisi-
tion of property is also to be regarded as implicit in 
those two legislative entries, surely articles 31 
(4), 
31-A and 31-B and in particular article 31 (4) which 
contain the words "notwithstanding anything 
in 
this 
Constitution" will protect the Act from such implied 
prov!S!on, 
for 
reasons 
I 
have 
already 
explained. 
Mr. P. R. Das's second main point must accordingly 
be rejected as untenable. 
Assuming that the necessity for the existence of a 
public purpose is not a provision of article 31 (2) but is 
a provision only of entry 36 
in 
List II and/or of 
entry 42 in List III and that consequently articles 31 ( 4 ), 
31-A and 31-B do not preclude the respondents from 
challenging the validity of the Act on the ground of 
the legislative incompetency arising out of the absence 
of a public purpose, the question still remains whether 
there is in fact a public purpose within the meaning of 
our Constitution to support the Act. It is to be noted 
that there is no recital of any public 
purpose . in the 
Act itself, but it is conceded that this circumstance is 
not fatal to the validity of the Act. 
It is, however, 
urged that this circumstance, nevertheless, shows that 
the Legislature had, at the time of the passing of the 
Act, no public purpose in its view. 
It is claimed 
• 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
993 
that, apart from the absence of any such recital, 
there is no indication whatever as to 
the 
existence 
of any public purpose in any of the operative provi-
sions 
of the Act. 
It is not disputed that as 
a 
result of this enactment a very large sum of money 
now payable by the tenants as and by way of current 
rent and arrears of rent to their respective landlords 
will be intercepted by the State but it is urged, on the 
authority of certain 
passages 
in 
Cooley's Constitu-
tional Lirri1tations, 8th Edn., Vol. II, p. 1U8 (Foot-
note 1) 
and in Professor Willis' Constitutional Law, 
p. 817, that the exercise of the power of taxation and 
not that of the power of eminent domain is the legiti-
mate means for swelling the public revenue. That the 
Act has no public purpose to support it is sought to be 
established by saying that ln Bihar the recorded pro-
prietors are 
about 
13,35,919 
in number 
and 
that 
assuming that there are four persons in a family, 
nearly five and a half million people will be ruined 
as a result of this legislation, although the actual tillers 
of the soil will derive no benefit whatever therefrom, 
for they will remain where they are and will have to 
continue, as heretofore, to pay rJ.eir rent, instead of to 
their present landlords, to the 
~tate which, they will 
find, is no better than a ruthless machine unsusceptible 
to any humane feeling. The contention is that the 
public purpose must be something definite, something 
tangible and something immediate and that there must 
be some indication of its existence in the Act itself and 
that the State cannot take private property to-day and 
say that it will think of the public purpose at its 
leisure. 
This leads me to a consideration 
of what 
is 
a 
public 
purpose 
within 
the meaning of our 
Constitution. 
We have been referred to some American authorities 
for ascertaining the meaning and implication of "public 
use", an expression which obviously is of a more 
limited import than the expression "public purpose" 
used in our Constitution. 
Apart from this, a perusal 
of the text books, e.g., Constitutional Law by Professor 
Willis, p. 817 et seq., will immediately make it clear

that the notion as to what is a "public use" is rapidly 
changing in America. 
Formerly "public use'', 
meant 
a use by the public. 
According to the modern view 
"public use" means useful to the public. 
The . passage 
in 
Cooley's 
Constitutional Limitations, 
Vol. 
II pp. 
1139-40 quoted by S. K. Das J. of the Patna High 
Court summarises the position thus :-
"No satisfactory definition of the term "public use" 
has ever been achieved by the Courts. 
Two different. 
theories are presented by the judicial attempts to des-
cribe the subjects to which the expression would apply. 
One theory of "public use" limits the application to 
"employment"-"occupation". 
A 
more 
liberal 
and 
more flexible 
meaning makes it 
synonymous 
with 
"public advantage", "public benefit". 
A little investi-
gation will show that any definition attempted would 
exclude some subjects that properly should be included 
in, and include some subjects that must be excluded 
from, the operation of the words "public use". As 
might be expected, the more limited application of the 
principle appears in the earlier cases, and the more 
liberal agplication 
has 
been 
rendered 
necessary 
by 
complex conditions due to recent 
d~velopments "of 
civilization and the increasing density of population. 
In the very nature of the case, modern cond
11tions and 
the increasing inter-dependence of the different human 
factors in the progressive complexity of a community 
make it necessary for the Government to touch upon 
and limit individual activities at more 
points 
than 
formerly". 
To the like effect are the 
be found in Corpus r uris, 
pp. 552 and 553 under the 
use":-

Vol. XX, article 39, at 
caption "What is a public 
• 
• 
"No general definition of what degrees of public. good 
will meet the constitutional requirements for a ·"public' 
use" can be framed, as it is in every case a question of 
J 
public policy. The meaning of ~e term is fl~xible and 
, ~ 
is not confined to what may constitute a public use at 
·any given time, but in general it may be said to cover 
• 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
995 
a use affecting the public generally, or any 
number 
thereof, as distinguished 
from 
particular 
individuals. 
Some Courts have gone so far in the direction of a 
liberal construction as to hold that "public use" is 
synonymous 
with 
"public benefit'', "public utility", ' 
or 
"public 
advantage", 
and 
to 
authorise 
the 
exercise of the power of eminent domain to pro-
mote 
such 
public 
benefit, 
etc., 
especially 
where 
the interests 
involved are 
of 
considerable 
magni-
tude, 
and 
it is 
sought 
to 
use 
the power 
in 
order 
that 
the natural resources 
and 
advantages 
of a locality may receive the fullest 
development in 
view of the general welfare". 
The learned author thereupon proceeds to 
discuss 
the more restricted meaning given to that expression. 
Mr. P. R. Das has drawn our attention to the decision 
of the Judicial Committee in Hamabai ·Framjee Petit 
v. Secretary of State for lndia(1). It should be borne 
in mind that the Judicial Committee in that case had 
to consider the meaning of the words "public purposes" 
occurring in a lease of the 
19th century. Even in 
1914 
the 
Judicial 
Committee did 
not think 
fit 
to attempt a precise 
definition 
of 
the expression 
"public purpose" 
and was 
content 
to quote with 
approval the following passage from the judgment of 
Batchelor J. ': -
"General 
definitions are, I 
think, 
rather to be 
avoided where the avoidance is possible, and I make 
no attempt to define precisely the extent of the phrase 
'public purposes' in the lease ; it is enough 
to 
say 
. that, in my opinion, the phrase, whatever else it may 
mean, must include a purpose, that is, an object or 
aim, in which the general interest of the community, 
as opposed to the particular interest of individuals, is 
directly and vitally concerned". 
And it is well that no hard and fast definition was 
laid down, for the concept of "public purpose" has 
been rapidly changing in all countries of the world.

interest of the community", however, clearly indicates 
that it is the presence of this element in an object. or 
aim which transforms such object or aim ino a public 
purpose. 
From what I have stated so far it follows that 
whatever furthers the general interests 
of 
the 
com-
munity as opposed to the particular interest of the in-. 
dividual must be regarded as a public purpose. 
With 
the onward march of civilization our notions as to the 
scope of the general interest of the community are fast 
changing and widening with the result that our old 
and narrower notions as to the sanctity of the private 
interest of the individual can no longer stem the · , 
forward flowing tide of time and must necessarily 
give way to the broader notions of the general interest 
of the community. 
The emphasis is unmistakably 
shifting from 
the 
individual 
to 
the 
community. 
This 
modern 
trend 
in 
the social 
and 
political 
philosophy is well reflected and given expression to in 
our Constitution. Our Constitution, as 
I 
understand 
it, has not ignored the individual but has endeavoured 
to harmonise the individual interest with the paramount 
interest of the community. As I explained in Gopalan's 
case (') and again in Chiranjit Lat's case (supra) our 
Constimtion protects the freedom of the citizen by 
article 19(1) (a) to ( e) and (g) but empowers the State, 
even while those freedoms last, to impose reasonable 
res~rictions on them in the interest of the State or of 
public order or morality or of the general public as 
mentioned in clauses (2) to (6). 
Further, the moment 
even this regulated freedom of the individual becomes 
incompatible wi,th and threatens the freedom of the 
community the State is given power by article 21, to 
<leprive the individual of his life and personal liberty 
in accordance with 
procedure 
established 
by 
law, 
subject, of 
course, to the provisions of article 22. 
Likewise, 
our 
Constimtion 
gives protection to the 
right of private property by article 19 ( 1) ( f) not 
absolutely but subject to reasonable restrictions to be 
imposed by law m the interest of the general public 
(1) [1950] S.C.R. 88.

under clause (5) and, what is more important, as soon 
a:i the interest of the 
community 
so requires, the 
State may, under article 31, deprive the owner of his 
property by authority of law subject to payment of 
compensation if the deprivation is by way of acquisi-
tion or requisition of the property by the State. 
It is 
thus quite clear that a fresh outlook which places the 
general interest of the community 
above the interes~ 
of the individual pervades our Constitution. 
Indeed, 
what sounded like idealistic slogans only in the recent 
past are now enshrined in the glorious preamble to 
our Constitution proclaiming the solemn resolve of the 
people of tills country to secure to all citizens justice, 
social, economic and political, and equality of status 
and 
of 
opportunity. 
What 
were 
regarded 
only 
yesterday, so to say, as 
fantastic formulae have now 
been accepted as directive principles of State policy 
prominently set out in Part IV of the Constitution. 
The ideal we have set before us in article 38 is, to evolve 
a State which must constantly strive to promote the 
welfare of the people by· securing and making as effec-
tively as it may 
be a social 
order in which social, 
economic and political justice shall inform all the in-
stitutions of the national life. 
Under article 39 the 
State is enjoined to direct its policy. towards securing, 
inter alia, that the ownership 
and 
control 
of 
the 
material resources of the community are so distributed 
as to subserve the common good and that the opera~ 
tion of the economic system does not result in the con-
centration of wealth and means of production to the 
common detriment. 
The 
words 
"public 
purposes" 
u.sied in article 23(2) indicate that the Constitution 
uses those words in a very large sense. 
In the never-
ending race the law must keep pace with the realities 
of the social and political evolution of the cow1try as 
reflected in the Constitution. If, therefore, the State 
is to give effect to these avowed purposes of our Con-
stitution we must regard as a public purpose all that 
will be calculated to promote the welfare of the people 
as envisaged in these 
directive 
principles of 
State 
policy whatever 
else that expression may mean.

[1952] 
the light of this new outlook what, I ask, is the pur-
pose of the State in adopting measure~ for the acquisi-
tion of the zamindaries and the interests of the inter-
mediaries ? Surely, it is to subserve the common good 
by bringing the land, which feeds 
and sustains the 
community and also 
produces 
wealth by its forest, 
mineral and other r=urces, under State ownership or 
control. 
This State ownership or control over land is 
a necessary preliminary step towards the implementa-
tion of the directive principles of State policy and it 
·cannot but be a public purpose. It cannot be overlooked 
that the directive principles 
set forth in Part IV of 
Constitution are not merely the policy of any 
partic · 
cular political party but are intended to be principles 
fixed by the 
Constitution 
for directing the State 
policy whatever party may come into power. 
Further, 
it must always be borne in 
mind that the object of 
.the impugned Act is not to authorise the stray acquisi-
tion of a particular property for a limited and narrow 
public purpose but that its 
purpose 
is to bring the 
bulk of the land 
producing 
wealth 
under 
State 
ownership or control by the abolition of the system 
of land tenure which has been found to be archaic 
and non-conducive 
to the 
general 
interest of the 
community. 
The 
Act 
also 
sets up a Land Com-
mission to advise 
the 
State Government generally 
with regard to the agrarian 
policy which it may 
from time to time follow. 
It is impossible to say that 
there is no public purpose to support the Act. 
This 
very Bihar Act was before the Constituent Assembly 
when it passed article 31 ( 4) and again when it took 
the trouble of amending the 
Constitution for saving 
this very Act. 
Would the Constituent Assembly have 
thought fit to protect these Acts unless it were 
con-
vinced that this Act was necessary in -the general 
interest of the community '? 
I find myself in agree-
ment with Reuben J. and S. K. Das J. that these cir-
cumstances also clearly 
indicate 
that the Constituent 
Assembly regarded this Act 
as well supported by· a 
.public ·purpose. ·To put a ·narrow· constniction on the 
expression "public purpose" will, to my mind, be to 
.,

S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS

defeat the general purpose of our Constitution and the 
particular 
and 
immediate 
purpose 
of the 
recent 
amendments. 
We must not read a measure imple-
menting 
our 
mid-twentieth 
century 
Constitution 
through spectacles tinted with early nineteenth century 
notions as to the sanctity or inviolability of individual 
rights. 
I, therefore, agree with the High Court that 
the impugned Act was enacted for a public purpose. 
Mr. P. R. Das then puts. up a narrow argument. 
Assuming, says he, that, there is· in the Act a general 
public purpose for compulsory acqui>9ition of zamin-
daries and 
tenures, there 
cannot conceivably be any 
public purpose in suport of the Act in so far as it 
authorises the taking 
of the 
arrears of rent or the 
taking away of 4 to 12! per cent. of the gross assets 
on the specious pka that 
the landlords must be 
supposed 
to 
spend that percentage of 
their gross 
income on works of benefit to the rayats of the 
estates and, therefore, that part of the Act is beyond 
the legislative competence of the 
Bihar 
Legislature. 
I regard this argument as unsound for more reasons 
than one. 
In the first place the existence of a public 
purpose being, as I hold, a provision of article 31 (2), 
its absence, if any, in relation 
to the arrears 
of 
rent cannot, by reason of articles 31 
(4), 31-A and 
31-B be made a ground of attack against the Act. 
Secondly, it is 
ari entirely wrong approach to pick 
out an item out of a scheme .of land reforms 
and 
say that that item is not supported by a public pur-
pose. 
One may just as well say that there is no 
public purpose in the acquisition of forests or of mines 
and particularly of u::ideveloped mines, for such acqui-
sition has no bearing on a scheme of agrarian reforms 
in that it does not improve or affect the conditions of 
the tillers of the surface of the soil. 
This, I appre-
hend, is not the right way of looking at things. 
The 
proper approach is to 
take 
the &cheme · as a whole 
and than examine 
whether 
the entire scheme of 
acqms1t10n 
is 
for 
a 
public 
purpose. 
Thirdly, 
I do not regard the deduction of 4 to 12! per cent. 
of the gross 
assets 
as 
acquisition or confiscation

[1952] 
at all, 
but I 
regard 
it, for 
reasons &tated above, 
as 
a 
part of 
a principle laid down by 
the Act 
for the purpose of determining the amount of compen-
sation as required by article 31 (2) and entry 42 in 
List III. 
Finally, I do not see why the taking over 
of the arrears of rent, in the context of the acquisition 
of zamindaries, is not for a public purpose. As I have 
said, the acquisition of 
zamindaries 
and tenures is a 
scheme for bringing about agrarian reforms and amelio-
rating the conditions of the 
tenants. 
The object is, 
inter alia, to bring the tillers of the soil in direct con-
tact with the States so as to free them from the clutches 
of 
rapacious landlords and make them the masters of 
their holdings subject to payments of the dues to the 
State. 
It is well-known that the bulk of the tenants 
are in arrears with their rents and once the rents fall 
into arrear the 
tenants 
find it 
difficult to pay the 
current rent after liquidating a part of the arrears so 
that while they clear part of the old arrears the current 
rent falls into 
arrear. 
According to annexure B (2) 
to the affidavit of Lakshman Nidhi affirmed on J anu-
ary 22, 1951, the total amount of Raiyati rent payable 
by the various tenants in 
the different circles of the 
Darbhanga Estate alone will exceed rupees three lacs. 
It is not quite clear whether all these arrears are due 
from the actual rayats in the sense of actual tillers of 
the soil. 
But leaving out from 
consideration for the 
present purposes the 
arrears of rent due 
by 
the 
-tenure-holders to 
their 
immediate superior tenure-
holder or to the zamindar it can safely be taken 
that 
the 
bulk, 
if not all, of the 
actual rayats 
or tiiJ!ers of the soil 
are 
habitually and perpetually 
in arrear 
with 
the rent 
of their 
holdings on 
account of financial 
stringency 
resulting from their 
chronic 
indebtedness. 
In these 
circumstances if the 
zamindaries and the tenures only are acquired under 
the Act leaving the zamindars and the tenure holders 
free to realise 
the huge arrears of rent due by the 
actual 
cultivating tenants by legal process 
it will 
eventually results in the sale of the holdings of the 
actual tenants or, at any rate, of their right, title and

interest therein and the 
possible purchase thereof by 
the zamindars or 
tenure-holders 
themselves at Court 
sales in execution of decrees or by private sales forced 
upon the tenants. The bulk of the actual tillers of the 
soil wiH then become landless labourers and the entire 
scheme of land reforms envisaged in the Act will be 
rendered wholly 
nugatory. 
If the acquisition of th~ 
zamindaries and the tenures is, as I hold, dictated or 
inspired by the sound public purpose of ameliorating 
the economic and 
political 
conditions of the actual 
tenants, the self same public purpose may well require 
the acquisition of the arrears of rent so as to avert the 
undesirable but inevitable consequences I have men-
tioned 
The 
Bihar 
Legislature 
obviouslly 
thought 
that the tenants in arears will 
have better treatment 
and a more reasonable accommodation, in the matter 
of the liquidation of the huge arrears, from the State 
which will act under the guidance of the Land Com-
mission than from the expropriated landlords whose sole 
surviving interest in their erstwhile tenants will only 
be to realise as much of the arrears as they can from 
the tenants and within 
the shortest 
possible time 
without any 
mercy or accommodation. The same re-
marks apply to the acquisition of decrees for arrears 
of rent. The overriding public purpose of ameliorating 
the conditions of the cultivating raya~ may well have 
induced the Legislature to treat the arrears of rent 
and the decrees 
for rent 
differently from the other 
ordinary moveable properties of 
the zamindars or 
tenure-holders, e.g., their money in the bank or their 
jewellery 
or 
ornaments 
with 
which 
the 
rayats 
have no concern and to 
provide for the acquisition 
of the 
arrears 
and the 
decrees. 
In the premises, 
the 
second 
main 
ground 
of 
attack 
levelled by 
Mr. P. R. Das against the Act must be rejected. 
I 
am, 
however, 
free to confess that if I 
could 
agree with Mr. P.

that these provisions 
. of the impugned Act are bad for want of a public 
purpose, I am not at all sure that I would not have 
found it extremely 
difficult 
to 
resist 
his 
further 
argument that the entire Act was bad, for it might

not have been very easy to presume that if the Bihar 
Legislature had 
known 
that these 
provisions of the 
Act might be held bad it would 
nevertheless have 
passed the other parts of the Act in that truncated 
form. 
The acquisition of the arrears of rent appears 
to me to be an integral part of the scheme and inextri-
cably interwoven with it. 
Indeed, it may well have 
been that the scheme of 
agrarian 
reform was not 
considered by the Bihar Legislature to be at all capa-
ble of easy implementation by the State without the 
acquisition of the arrears of rent. 
As, however, I have 
taken the view that no par:t of the Act is bad for want 
of a public purpose, I need not pursue any further the 
question of the severability of the Act or to refer to 
the judicial decisions relied on by learned counsel on 
both sides. 
Re Ground C: Mr. P. R. Das's third point is that 
the Act constitutes a fraud 
on the Constitution, that 
is to say, while it purports to be in conformity with 
the Constitution, it, in effect, constitutes a defiance of 
it. 
The Act, according to 
him, pretends to comply 
with the constitutional 
requirements 
in that it sets 
out to lay down certain principles on which compen-
sation is to be 
determined 
and the 
form and the 
manner in which such 
compensation 
is to be given 
but, in effect, makes out a scheme for non-payment of 
compensation. 
The Act, he 
urges, 
purports to pay 
back fifty per cent. of the arrears of rent as compensa-
tion but in reality confiscates the other fifty per cent. 
without any compensation. 
Further, under the guise 
of deducting· 4 to 12f per cent. of the gross income 
the State is in reality appropriating a large sum under 
tllli head. 
All this, he concludes, is nothing but pre-
tence or a mere shift and contrivance for confiscating 
private 
property. 
The 
argument, when properly 
understood, will 
be found to 
resolve itself into an 
attack on 
the 
legislative 
competency of the Bihar 
Legislature to pass this Act. 
On ultimate analysis it 
amounts to nothing more than saying that while 
pretending 
to 
give 
compensation 
the Act does 
not really give it. It is the absence of a provision 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
1003 
for 
just 
and 
adequate 
compensation 
that mak~ 
the 
Act 
bad, 
because, 
according 
to Mr. 
P. 
R. 
Das, the legislative 
power 
under entry 36 in List 
II and entry 42 in List III requires the making of such 
a prov1S1on. 
The failure to comply with this consti-
tutional condition for the exercise of legislative power 
may be overt or it may be covert. 
When h is overt, 
we say the law is obviously bad for non-compliance 
with the requirements of 
the 
Constitution, that is to 
say, the law is ultra vires. 
When, however, the non-
compliance is covert, we say that it is a fraud on the 
Constitution, the fraud complained of being that the 
Legislature pretends to act within its power while in 
fact it is not so doing. Therefore, the charge of fraud 
on the Constitution is, on 
ultimate analysis, nothing 
but a picturesque 
and 
epigrammatic way of expres-
sing the idea of non-compliance with the terms of the 
·Constitution. Take the case of the acquisition of the ar-
rears of rent. It is said that the provision in the Act for 
the acquisition of arrears of rent is a fraud on the legis-
lative power given by the Constitution. I ask myself as 
to why must it be characterised as a fraud ? I find nothing 
in the Constitution which says that the arrears of rent 
must not be acquired and, therefore, there is no neces-
sity for any covert attempt to do what is not prohibit-
ed. 
I have already explained that in a scheme of land 
<eforms such as is envisaged in the Act the acquisition 
of the arrears of rent 
may 
properly 
accompany the 
acquisition of the zamindaries and the tenures. 
Where, 
then, does this theory of fraud come in? The answer 
must eventually be that a moiety of arrears are taken 
away without compensation. 
Again, take the case of 
the 
acquisition 
of 
non-income-yielding 
properties. 
Why, I ask, is it called a fraud on the Constitution to 
take such 
property ? Does the 
Constitution prohibit 
the acquisition 
of such 
property ? Obviously it does 
not. 
Where, then, is the fraud ? The answer that 
comes to imy mind is that it is fraud because the Act 
provides for compensation only on the baSiis of income 
and, therefore, 
properties 
which 
are 
at 
present 
non-income-yielding 
but 
whii;h 
have

potentialities are acquired 
without 
any compensation 
at all. 
Similar answer 
becomes 
obvious in connec-
tion with the 
deduction of 4 to 
12~ per cent. of 
the gross assets under the head "Works of Benefit 
to the 
Rayats". 
On 
ultimate 
analysis, 
therefore, 
the Act is really 
attacked on 
the 
ground that 
it 
fails to 
do what is 
required by the Constitution 
to do, namely, to . provide for 
compensation for the 
acquisition of the 
properties and 
is, therefore, ultra 
vires. This, to my mind, is the same argument as to 
the absence of just compensation 
in a different form 
and expressed in a picturesque and 
attractive langu-
age. 
I have already 
dealt 
with the 
question 
of 
absence of a 
provision 
for just 
compensation while 
dealing with Mr. P. R. Das's first point and I repeat 
that the obligation to provide for compensation is not 
implicit in entry 36 List II by itself or read with 
entry 42 
in 
Lisit: 
III 
but is to be found only in 
article 31 (2), that under entry 42 in List III the Act 
has laid down a principle for determining compensa-
tion and, therefore, 
there can be 
no question as to 
legislative 
incompetency for 
any 
alleged non-compli-
ance with any supposed 
requirement said to be im-
plicit . in these entries. 
If the principles so laid down 
in the Act do not in any rare case produce any com-
pensation or do not 
produce 
adequate compensation 
in some cases, such 
absence of 
compensation may be 
a contravention 
of 
article 
31 (2) 
but in view of 
articles 31 (4), 31-A and 31-B and particularly due to 
the words "notwithstanding anything in this Constitu-
tion" occurring in article 31 ( 4) it cannot be made a 
ground of attack on the Act, even though such ground 
is formulated 
in a 
different 
but attractive language, 
namely, as a fraud on the Constitution. Accordingly, 
this point must also be 
rejected. 
I, however, repeat 
that if I took a different view I would still have the 
same difficulty as to the inseverability of the different 
provisions 
of 
the 
Act 
as 
I 
have 
hereinbefore 
indicated. 
Re. Ground D : Mr. P. R. Das's fourth point is 
that the Act is unenforceable in that section 32 (2) 
.. 
t 
I -
_, 
• 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
1005 
provides for compensation in forty equal instalments 
without specifying the period 
of interval between the 
instalments. 
In course of arguments, however, Mr. P. 
R. Das has thought fit not to 
preSlil this point and 
accordingly it does not require any refutation. 
Re. Ground E : Mr. P. R. Das's last main point is 
that 
the 
Act 
has 
delegated 
essential 
legislative 
functions to 
the 
Effective 
Government 
and 
is, 
therefore, invalid. 
Article 31 (2) requires that the 
law authorising the taking 
poss,ession or the acquisi-
tion of 
land 
for 
public 
purpose 
should provide 
for 
compensation 
for the property taken possession 
of or acquired and should either fix the amount or 
specify the principles on which, and the manner in 
which the compensation is to be determined and given. 
Entry 42 in List III talks of principles on which com-
pensation is to be 
determined and 
the form and the 
manner in which such compensation is to be given. 
The argument is that the Constitution has left to 
Parliament or the State Legislature the duty of specify-
ing the principle on which, and the form and manner 
in which the 
compensation is 
to be determined and 
given but the Bihar 
Legislature by section 3 (22) of 
the Act has simply provided that the amount of com-
pensation shall be paid i:n cash or in bonds or partly 
in cash and partly in bonds and that the bonds shall 
be either negotiable or non-negotiable and non-trans-
ferable and be payable in forty equal instalments and 
has 'not laid down any decisive provision but has left 
the matter to the State Government to decide. 
It has, 
therefore, 
failed 
to 
discharge the 
duty which was 
expressly left to its knowledge, wisdom and patriotism. 
Mr. P. R. Das 
complains 
that the 
Legislature has 
shirked its responsibility and delegated this essential 
legislative power to 
the 
State 
Government to be 
exercised under rules made by itself under its rule-
making power under section 43 (2) (p). The question 
of the propriety and legality of the delegation of legis-
lative power has recently 
been 
considered 
by 
this 
Court in In re The Delhi Laws Act, 1912 etc.(1). If I

[1952] 
were to deal with this matter according to my own 
notions, I 
would have 
dismissed 
this argument in 
limine, for here the Legii>lature has not abdicated or 
effaced itself in 
the 
sense I have 
explained in my 
opinion in that case. 
When I look at the matter on 
the basis of the principles laid down in that case by 
the late 
Chief 
Justice 
and my 
learned brothers to 
which Mr. P. R. Das has referred, I have to overrule 
his contention all the 
same. 
Here section 32 clearly 
indicates that the Legislature has applied its mind to 
the problem and it has laid down the principle that 
the compensation may be paid in cash or in bonds or 
pardy in cash and 
partly in 
bonds 
and that if a 
payment is 
to be 
made 
either wholly or partly in 
bonds, 
these 
bonds 
may 
be 
either 
negotiable 
or 
non-negotiable 
and 
non-transferable. 
Having 
laid 
down 
the 
principle, 
the 
Legislature has, by a rule 
made under section 43 (3) (p), left it to the Execu-
tive 
to 
determine 
the 
proportion 
in 
which 
the 
compensation 
shall 
be 
payable 
in 
cash and in 
bonds 
and the manner of such payment of com-
pensation. 
These details, it will be observed, depend 
on special circumstances, e.g., the extent of the ability 
of Government to pay, the extent of the necessities of 
the proprietors and 
many other considerations, 
with 
which the 
Executive 
Government would 
be 
more 
familiar than the Legislature itself. 
I am unable to 
accept Mr. P. R. Das's contention that this amounts 
to a delegation of an essential legislative 
function 
within the 
meaning· of the decision of my learned 
brothers. 
. 
Mr. Sanjiva Chowdhuri has urged that the Land 
Acquisition Act, 
1894 being 
continued by the Con-
stitution and that Act which is a Central Act having 
been 
extended by 
notilication in 
1899 to Ramgarh 
State for 
which he 
appears, the 
Central Act must 
apply to Ramgarh until the notification is withdrawn 
and the impugned Act cannot apply for determining 
the compensation, for the field is already occupied by 
the Central Act of 1894. 
It may, however, be noticed 
that the provision 
for 
compensation in that Act 
•
.. 
. S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
1007 
applies only to lands acquired under that Act. It has 
no application to lands acquired 
under other statutes 
and, therefore, the provision for 
compensation of the 
Land Acquisition 
Act 
cannot . apply to acquisitions 
under the Bihar 
Act and, 
therefore, the doctrine of 
occupied field can 
have no 
application. 
In my opi-
nion there is no substance in this contention. 
For reasons stated above, I allow these appeals. 
CHANDRASEKHARA ArYAR J.-The faits which 
have 
given rise to these cases have been fully set out in the 
judgment just now 
delivered by 
my learned brother 
Mahajan J. 
and need not be repeated. 
The conclu-
sions reached by him and Mukherjea J. have 
my 
concurrence. 
Ordinarily, I 
would have stopped with 
the expression of my agreement, but having regard to 
the importance of the guestion argued and the stakes 
i,nvolved, I desire to add a few words of my own on 
some of the points discussed. 
Article 31 (I) of our Constitution provides "No per-
son shall be 
deprived of his property 
save by autho-
rity of law". 
There are three modes of deprivation-(a) destruc-
tion, (b) acquisition and ( c) requisition. 
Destruction 
may take place in the interests of public health or the 
prevention of danger to life or property, but with this 
we are not now concerned. 
In the case of "acquisition", 
there is an element of permanency, and in the case of 
"requisition" there 
is 
an element of temporariness. 
Except for this distinction, 
both modes stand on the 
same 
footing, 
as 
regards the rights 
of the State 
vis-a-vis the rights of the private citizens. 
Under the Constitution, when property is requisition-
ed or acquired, it may be for a Union purpose or a 
State 
purpose, 
or for 
any · other 
public purpose. 
Entry 33 in List I (Union List) of the Seventh Schedule 
to the Constitution speaks of acquisition or requisition-
ing of property for the purposes of the Union. 
When 
we come to entry 42 of List III (Concurrent List), we 
find these 
words : "Principles on which compensation 
for property acquired or requisitioned for the purposes

of the Union or of a State or for any other public pur-
pose is to be determined, and the form and the manner 
in which such compensation is to be given." 
From very early times, law has recognized the right 
of Government 
compulsorily to acquire private pro-
perties of individuals for a public purpose and this has 
come to be known as the law of eminent domain. 
But it is a principle of universal law that the acquisi-
tion can 
only be on 
payment of just compensation. 
Story on the Constitution, Vol. 2, page 534, paragraph 
.1790, has the following passage in discussing the con-
cluding clause of the Fifth Amendment of the American 
Constitution : 
. "The concluding clause is 
that private property 
shall not be taken for public use witltout just compen-
sation. This is an 
affirmance . of a great doctrine esta-
blished by the common law for the protection of 
private property. 
It is 
founded in 
natural equity, 
and is laid down by jurists as a principle of universal 
law. 
Indeed, 
in 
a free 
government, 
almost 
all 
other 
rights 
would 
become 
utterly 
worthless, 
if 
the 
Government possessed 
an uncontrollable power 
over 
the private fortune of every citizen. One of 
the fundamental objects of every good government 
must be the due administration of justice ; and how 
vain it would 
be to speak of such an administration, 
when all property is subject to the will or caprice of 
the legislature and the rulers." 
The payment of compensation is an essential ele-
ment of the valid exercise of the power to take. In the 
leading case of Attorney-General v. De Keyser' s Royal 
Hotel, Ltd. (') Lord Dunedin spoke of the payment of 
compensation as a necessary concomitant to the 
tak-
ing of property. 
Bowen L. J. said in London and North 
We~tern Ry. Co. v. Evans (') :-
"The Legislature 
cannot fairly be supposed to in-
tend, in the absence of clear words showing such 
intention, that one man's property shall be confiscated 
for the benefit of others, or of the public, without any

compensation being provided for him in respect of 
what is taken compulsorily from him. Parliament in 
its omnipotence can, of course, override or disregard 
this ordinary principle ...... if it sees fit to do so, but it 
is not likely 
that it will be found disregarding it, 
without plain expres1sions of such a purpose." 
This principle is embodied in article 31 (2) of our 
Constitution in these terms :-
"~o prop_erty, 
i:iovable or immovaJ:le, 
including 
any mterest m, or m any company ownmg, any com-
mercial or industrial undertaking, shall be taken pos-
session of or acquired for public purposes under any 
law authorising the taking of such possession or such 
acquisition, unless the law provides for compensation 
for the property taken possession of or acquired 
and 
either fixes 
the amount 
of 
the compensation, or 
specifies the principles on which, and the manner in 
which, the compensation 
JS to be determined and 
given." 
We shall not here trouble ourselves with sub-clauses 
(3) and (4) of the article and with articles 31-A and 
31-B 
which were introduced by way of amendment 
under the 
Constitution First 
Amendment Act, 1951, 
dated 18-6-1951. 
They will be considered later. 
The argument of Shri P. R. Das that the payment 
of compensation 
is a 
concomitant 
obligation to the 
compulsory acquisition of properties by the State can 
be accepted as sound ; but when he went further and 
urged that it was found in an implicit form in entry 42 
of the Concurrent List, he 
was by no means on sure 
ground. The entries give us the bare heads of legisla-
tion. 
For ascertairU,ng the scope or extent or ambit of 
the legislation and 
the rights 
and the duties created 
thereby, we must . examine the legislation itsdf or 
must have 
resort 
to 
general 
and 
well-recognized 
principles of law of 
jurisprudence. 
No resort can be 
had to anything implicit or hidden when the statute 
makes an express provision on the same subject. As 
just compensation has to 
be paid 
when property is 
acquired for a 
public purpose, the legislation has to

[1952] 
formulate the principles for 
determining the compen-
sation and the form and the manner in which it is ·to 
be given. 
Entry 42 means nothing more than a 
power conferred on the Legislature for achieving this 
end. 
The power is conferred but there is no duty 
cast to provide for compensation. 
For any statement 
that the payment of compensation is a primary condi-
tion for acquisition of 
property for a public purpose, 
we have to look at the provisions of the Constitution 
itself and this we find in 
article 31(2) 
as 
stated 
already. 
Mr. Das was obliged to take up the unten-
able position that entry 42 of its own force implies 
an obligation 
to 
pay compensation, as he could not 
otberwi:;e jump over the hurdles created in his way by · 
sub-sections 
(3) and (4) of 
article 
31 and the new 
articles 31-A and 31-B. 
The learned 
Attorney-General 
contended in dealing 
with entry 42 that legislation under entry 42 can also 
lay down principles that would lead to the non-pay-.• 
ment 
of 
any 
compensation 
and he 
cited 
Atiqa 
Begum's case(') as an authority in his support. This 
contention appears to me to be 
as 
unsound 
as 
Mr. Das's argument that the obligation to pay or give 
compensation was implicit in the. said entry. 
As there 
can be no acquisition without 
compensation, th'e terms 
of entry 42 enable the legislature 
to lay down the 
principles and provide further 
for 
the form and . 
manner of payment. 
If the principles are so formu~ 
lated as to result in non-payment altogether, then 
the legislature would be evading the law not only covert-
ly but flagrantly. 
There is nothing in Atiqa Begum's 
case that supports 
the 
argument. 
It was there hefd' 
that under the head "payment of rent" there could be 
legislation· providing for 
remission of rent. 
Payment 
of rent is not a legal obligation of every tenure and the 
· ~ 
legislature can enact that under certain 
circumstances 
.or conditions there shall be remission of rent. 
But as· 
.regards 
compensation 
foi State 
acqu1S1t:lon, its pay-
.. 
. ment is a primary requisite universally recognized by 
)"": 
law~ · This is 
the essential 
distinction to remember 
(!) [1940] F.C.R. 110. 
• 
, 
S.C.R. 
SUPREME COURT REPORTS 
1011 
when we seek to apply the case quoted. The last words 
in entry 42 "form 
and the 
manner in which such 
compensation is 
to be 
given" 
clearly mean that the 
principles determining compensation 
must lead to the 
giving or payment of some <:01npensation. 
To negate 
compensation altogether by the enunciation of principles. 
leading to such a result would be to contradict the 
very terms of the entry and such a meaning could not 
be attributed to the framers of the Lists. 
This, however, does not carry Shri P. R. Das any-
where near success. Article 31 ( 4) is the first stumbling 
block in· his way. 
It provides :-
"If any Bill pending at the commencement of this 
Constitution in the Legislature of a State has, after it 
has been passed by such Legislature, beert reserved for 
the consideration of 
the 
President 
and has received 
his assent, then, notwithstanding anything m this 
Constitution, the law so assented to shall not be called 
in question in any court on the ground that it contra-
venes the provisions of clause (2)." 
The Bill which subsequently became "The Bihar 
Land Reforms Act, 1950" was pending at 
the com-
mencement of the Constitution in the 
legislature 
of 
the State, and 
after it 
was passed by the legislature, 
it was reserved for the consideration of the President 
and received 
his 
assent. 
Therefore the bar that it 
shall not be 
called in 
question in any court on the 
ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2) 
becomes applicable. 
True, 
compensation 
has 
to be 
provided for, by reason of sub-clause (2) of the article, 
but sub-clause ( 4) 
postulates an exception and the 
right to challenge the validity of the Act on the ground 
that no compensation has been provided for or that the 
compensation is really illusory or inadequate ts taken 
away. 
As if this were not enough, two more stiles have 
been erected in his way and they are the new articles 
31-A and 
31-B 
brought 
in by 
way of amendment. 
Article 31-A, sub-clause (1) is in these terms;:-

obligation entitles him to challenge the validity of the 
Act as unconstitutional. 
The acquisition of property can only be for a public 
purpose. 
Under the Land Acquisition Act, I of 1894, 
a declaration by · the Government that land is needed 
for a public purpose shall be conclusive evidence that 
the land· is so needed and Courts cannot go into the 
question whether the 
public purpose 
has been made 
out or not. There is no such provision in any article 
of the Constitution with which we have to deal. It is 
true that sub-clause (2) of article 31 speaks of pro-
perty being 
acquired for 
public purposes. 
The bar 
created by sub-clause ( 4) of article 31 relates to the 
contravention of the provisions of clause (2). 
The 
provision of clause (2) is only as regards compen-
sation as can be gathered from its latter part :-
"Unless the 
law 
provides 'for · compensation for 
the property taken possession of or acquired and either 
fixes the amount of the compensation, or specifies the 
principles on which, 
and the 
manner in which, the 
compensation is to be determined and given." 
It is assumed, rightly, that the existence of a public 
purpose is · part and parcel of · the law and is inherent 
in it. 
The existence of a public purpose is not a pro-
VlSlOn or 
condition 
imposed by 
article 31 (2) as a 
limitation on the exercise of the power of acquisition. 
The condition prescribed is only as regards 
compen~ 
sation. Article 31 ( 4) debars the challenge of the con-
stitution.ality of an Act on this ground but no other. 
Whether there is any public 
purpose at all, or whe-
ther the purpose stated is such a purpose is open, in 
my opinion, to judicial scrutiny or review. 
When the legislattire declares that there is a public 
purpose behind the 
legislation, we 
have of course to 
respect its words. · The object of the Act in question 
is to extinguish the 
interests 
of 
intermediaries like 
zamindars, proprietors, and estate and tenure-holders 
etc., and to bring 
the actual 
cultivators into direct 
relations with the State Government. 
To achieve this 
end, several provisions have been enacted for the

transfer and the vesting of such interest m the State 
as regards various items of ptoperties. 
It is impos.•iblc 
to deny that the Act is inspired and dominated by a 
public purpose, but the question still remains whether 
the taking over of particular items can be said to be for 
a public purpose. It is in 
thi~ connection that the two 
items of "arrears of rent" and "cost of works of benefit 
to the raiyats" dealt with in section 4, clause (b), and 
section 23, clause ( f), respectively of the Act, have to 
be considered. 
The taking over of "arrears of rent" does not seem 
to have even a remote connection with any question of 
land reform. 
It stands on no better footing than if 
the Act sought to take over the cash on hand or in 
the banks of the 
zamindars, proprietors or tenure-
holders. 
It is only an accident that the rents in ques-
tion were not 
realised before the passing of the Act. 
Whether realised or not, they are his moneys due and 
payable to him by 
the ryots. 
The consequences of 
vesting of estates 
must have 
some relation 
to 
the 
tenures themselves and 
have some connection, remote 
though it may be, 
with the agrarian reforms under-
taken or contemplated. 
Supposing that we have a 
legislation stating that as it is necessary to eliminate 
rent collectors and 
farmers of revenue and to appor-
tion and distribute land on an equitable basis amongst 
the . tillers of the land and confer on them rights of 
permanent occupancy and also to bring them directly 
into contact with the State, all moneys which the pro-
prietors had collected as and by way of rent from 
their estates for three years prior to the commence-
ment of the Act, shall vest in and be payable to the 
State, could it be said by 
any stretch of reason that 
any public purpose had been established for the taking 
of the moneys ? 
Arrears of rent stand on no better 
footing. Any public purpose 
in taking 
them over is 
conspicuous by its absence. 
It is fairly obvious 
that 
resort was· had to 
the 
arrears either 
for augmenting 
the financial resources of the State or for paying com-
pensation to the smaller proprietors out of this parti-
cular item of acquisition.

of Darbhanga 
Sub-clause (1) of section 24 no doubt provides that 
50 per cent. of the arrears of rents shall be added to 
the amount of compensation. This means one of two 
things (a) 
either the other 50"/o is taken without 
payment of any compensation, which 
is 
confiscation 
virtually or (b) 50 per cent. is taken as the con-
solidated value of the 
arrear~ of rent-lump sum 
payment for the acquisition of choses in action or 
actionable claims. 
Taken either way, it is difficult to 
see wherein the public purpose 
consists. 
Whether 
moneys could 
be 
compulsorily acquired at all by a 
State is a moot question. Willis say!l in his Constitu-
tional Law at page 816:-"While, as stated above, 
any and all property is in general subject to the exer-
cise of the power of eminent domain, there are certain 
rather unusual forms of private property which can-
not thus be taken. 
These are corpses, money, choses 
in action, property used by the government in its 
governmental capacity, property to be used for a mere 
substituted ownership unless such substituted owner-
ship i.s a more necessary use, and perhaps trust pro-
perty dedicated to a State, mortgage liens, and suits 
to quiet title." 
Under the heading "what property is 
subject to the right'', Cooley observes in Vol. II of his 
book on Constitutional Limitations, at page 1117:-
"From this 
statement, 
however, 
must be excepted 
money, or that which in ordinary use passes as such, 
and which the Government may reach by taxation, 
and also rights in action, which can only be available 
when made to produce money; neither of which can 
it be needful to take under this power." In the foot-
note he points out:-

[1952] 
"Taking money 
under 
the right 
of 
eminent 
domain, when it must be compensated in money after-
wards, could be nothing more or less than a forced 
loan, only to be justified as a last resort in a time of 
extreme peril, where neither the credit of the govern-
ment nor the 
power of 
taxation 
could be made 
available." 
Nicols in his work on "Eminent Domain" does not 
disagree with this view ; on the other hand, he says at 
page 100 of Vol. I, paragraph 2. 1 (3) :-
"The question has 
arisen whether money 
can 
be taken by eminent 
domain 
and 
it has 
been 
held or intimated, at least 
in 
so 
far as 
a state 
or a private corporation · is 
concerned, 
that it is 
not subject 
to 
such taking. 
The objection is not 
based on an implied inherent limitation upon the 
power of government, but 
upon 
the 
difficulty of 
effecting a taking of money that would· be of any 
service · to the public 
without violating 
the Con-
stitution. 
The use for 
which it was 
needed might 
well be public, but, as compensation must be paid in 
money, and, if not in advance, at least with such ex-
pedition as conveniently may be had, the seizure 
of 
money without compensation, or with. an offer of pay-
ment in notes, bonds or merchandise,-in other words, 
a forced· sale or loan- however it might be justified by 
dire necessity would 
not be 
a constitutional exercise 
of the power of eminent domain." 
· The 'learned Attorney-General sought to justify this 
acquisition on the ground that it was a compulsory 
taking of choses in action. 
Even so, 
they stand on 
the same footing as money, of less value no doubt than 
if they 
were coin or currency notes. 
It seems that 
choses in action too cannot be so acquired ; reference 
has been made already to Cooley's observations.

a Water Supply 
Company was 
under a contract 
to supply water to the 
town of 
New Lots (which 
subsequently became merged in the city of Brooklyn) 
in consideration of 
the 
town 
paying for 
hydrants 
to be furnished and supplied as provided in the 
contract. 
The contract was for a 
term of 25 years. 
When the merger took 
place, the city 
of Brooklyn 
was given 
power to purchase 
or to 
condemn the 
property of the company within 
2 years but it did 
neither. 
In 1892, the 
legislature passed another Act 
authorising the City of Brooklyn to condemn the 
property 
of the 
company, 
provided 
the 
necessary 
proceedings were 
commenced 
within 
one year after 
the passing of the Act. 
The procedure for the acqui-
sition was prescribed in the 
Act 
itself. The power 
was exercised by the city and the 
compensation pay-
able was determined by the Commissioners at a parti-
cular figure. 
The company 
objected to the acquisi-
tion on the strength of article l, Paragraph 10, of the 
U. 
S. 
Constitution 
which 
forbids 
any 
State 
to 
pass a 
law 
impairing the 
obligation 
of 
contracts 
and was not "due 
process 
of law" as 
required by 
the 
14th 
Amendment. 
On error, 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
confirmed 
the 
condemnation 
and 
rejected 
the argument 
that 
there was 
any 
impairment 
of 
the contract. 
Mr. 
Justice 
Brewer 
points out that 
the contract is a mere incident to the tangible property 
and that it is the later which, being fitted for public 
uses, is 
condemned. 
The contract is not the thing 
which is sought to be condemned and its impairment, 
if impairment there be, is a mere consequence of the 
appropriation of the tangible property. 
In the present 
cases, it is untenable 
to state 
that the taking over of 
arrears of rent is a natural consequence of the acquisi~ 
tion of the estates. 
In the latter case, a railroad company filed a suit to 
condenin a right of way for an elevated railroad track 
across the public 
landing at 
Cincinnati. 
The city 
objected on the ground that the public landing 
had 
become 
property 
dedicated to the 
public under an 
earlier contract and to allow the condemnation under a

statute of Ohio was an impairment of the contract, 
forbidden by the 10th section of the first article of the 
Constitution of the United States. 
The court through 
Mr. Justice Lurton held : ''The constitutional inhibition 
upon any state law impairing the obligation of contracts 
is not a limitation upon the power of eminent domain. 
The obligation of a contract is not impaired when it is 
appropriated to a public use and compensation made 
therefor. 
Such an exertion of power neither challenges 
it.• validity nor impairs its obligation. 
Both are recog-
nised, for it is appropriated as an existing enforceable 
contract. It is a taking, not an impairment of its obli-
gation. 
If compensation be made, no 
constitutional 
right is violated." 
It would thus be evident that they were not cases of 
the compulsory acquisition of choses in action. Choses 
in action unrelated 
to any 
tangible 
property can be 
useful for a public purpose only when converted into 
money. 
Arrears of money are particularly so. 
When 
it is said that money and choses in action are exempt 
· from compulsory acquisition, it is not on the ground 
that they 
are 
movable 
property but on the ground 
that generally speaking there could be no public pur-
pose in their acquisition. 
The provisions in section 23, sub-clause (£) that 4 to 
12! per cent. of the gross assets can be deducted from 
the amount as representing "cost of works of benefit to 
th~ raiyats". 
This is, an obvious device to reduce the 
gross assets and 
bring it down to as low a level as 
possible. 
The Act does 
not say that this charge re-
presents 
the 
expenditure 
on 
works of 
benefit or 
improvements 
which 
the 
zamindars 
and proprietors 
were under any legal obligation to carry out and which 
l
they failed to discharge. 
Nor 
are we told anything 
1
about the future destination of this. deducted sum. It 
is an arbitrary 
figure which 
the legislature has said 
must be deducted from the gross assets. 
The deduc-
tion i• a mere contrivance to reduce the compensation 
<1
and it is a colourable or fraudulent exercise of legisla-
""
tive power to subtract a fanciful 
sum from the 
calculation of gross assets.

Stripped of their veils or vestments, the 
r~ov1S1ons 
in the Act about "arrears of rent" and the "cost of 
works of benefit" amount to naked confiscation. Where 
the legislative action is arbitrary in the sense that 
it 
has no reasonable relation to the purpose in view, there 
is a transgression by the legislature of the limits of its 
power. Under the guise of legislating for 
acquisition, 
the legislature cannot enable the State l 
'Ocrpetrate 
confiscation ; and if it does so, the Act to that extent · 
has to be declared unconstitutional and void. If the 
part that is void is so inextricably interwoven into the 
texture of the rest, the whole Act has 
to be struck 
.down. Such, however, is not the case here. 
It is gratifying to note that the Madhya Pradesh 
AboJition o{ Proprietory Rights Act of 1950 and 
the 
Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms 
Act of 1950 which are also in question are free from 
this blemish of reaching at arrears of rent due for any 
period anterior to the date of vesting.
